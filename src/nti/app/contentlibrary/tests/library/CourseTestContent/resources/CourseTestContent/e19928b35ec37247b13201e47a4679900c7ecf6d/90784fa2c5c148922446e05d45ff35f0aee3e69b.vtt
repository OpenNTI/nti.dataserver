00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.039
Welcome to Law and Justice. I'm your professor,
Kyle Harper. This is a course that explores

2
00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.140
the history of law and justice. This is a
class about history and it's a class about

3
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.390
the political philosophy of justice. It's
a course that starts with the very earliest

4
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.079
written law codes in ancient Babylonia. It's
a course that focuses in particular on the

5
00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:37.370
legacy of classical Greece and Rome. It's
a course that covers the Middle Ages and takes

6
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.550
us into the modern world when the great transformations
of the enlightenment and the industrial revolution

7
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.640
would forever alter the nature of justice.
This class is a history class. We're interested

8
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.730
in the actual experiences of past civilizations.
We're interested in the kinds of societies

9
00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.260
that humans have lived in. We're interested
in the ways that the conditions of those societies

10
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.670
influence and shape their conceptions of justice.
We're interested in the actual forms of government

11
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.659
that humans have lived under. We're interested
in the actual laws that they've created. We're

12
00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.840
also interested in the philosophy of justice
and so we'll be reading political philosophers,

13
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.860
the minds who've helped us understand what
the nature of justice truly is, and we'll

14
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.500
be combining those two approaches--both the
historical and the philosophical throughout

15
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.700
the course. This is a course about law and
justice so it'd be well if we started by defining

16
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.640
these two terms.
Law, what is a law? When you think of law

17
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.680
you think of a rule and for this class I want
us to define a law as a rule that's enforced

18
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.689
by a state. A rule that's enforced by a state,
and so that's different from a custom which

19
00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.700
may be rules that are obeyed by society or
in a primitive or stateless society may be

20
00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.719
powerful social norms. A, a law is a rule
that's enforced by the power, by the entire

21
00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:08.719
coercive power of the state--some entity that
has sovereignty, some entity that has power,

22
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.910
that has legitimate authority over the people
living in that society.

23
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.730
Justice. What is justice? That's a question
that we'll explore over the entire course.

24
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.840
What is justice? And it's a word that goes
back to the ancient languages. The origins

25
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.840
of justice, justitia are in Latin. Justitia,
in turn, comes from the word jus, a Latin

26
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.459
word, a Roman word, a word that means something
like "the right principle" and so the word

27
00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:47.459
Jus, the word justitia, becomes our English
justice. What does it mean in English, justice?

28
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.650
In some basic sense it means fairness. When
we say something is just we mean that it's

29
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.940
fair. When we say something's just we mean
that intuitively, almost instinctively we

30
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.120
feel that, that something is right about the
way it is done or distributed and let's go

31
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.269
with this for our definition of justice. Justice
is giving each person their due. Justice is

32
00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.140
giving each person what they deserve. And
throughout this course the recurring questions

33
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.519
we'll be asking are: how do you determine
what someone deserves, how do you determine

34
00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.260
what someone is due? What are the grounds
of dessert? What are the grounds of merit?

35
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.260
How do we as a society determine what someone
deserves? We'll ask questions about what makes

36
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.870
a society just. We'll ask questions about
what makes a law just. We'll see how different

37
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.549
societies have tried to answer these questions.
Throughout the course we'll be also taking

38
00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.150
up debates. We'll be looking at problems of
justice, hard questions, questions that encourage

39
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.189
us to think critically--to think hard about
what makes a society, what makes a situation,

40
00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:58.900
what makes a law or a rule just? And so as
we explore these questions together we'll

41
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.140
be engaging in debates and we'll have different
opinions, we'll have different points of view

42
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.860
about what are the grounds of justice and
that's how we'll sharpen our understanding

43
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.110
of what justice truly is. I hope that throughout
this course you'll gain a deeper understanding

44
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.290
of our own conceptions of justice. By understanding
history you can understand how our own conceptions

45
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.430
of justice arose and what they owed to the
past. You can understand how our conceptions

46
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.440
of justice may be different from conceptions
of justice that have existed in past societies.

47
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.759
It's the goal of this course that you'll come
away with a deeper understanding of your own

48
00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:41.360
conceptions of justice, indeed, of our broadly
shared American conceptions of justice. By

49
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.060
understanding history you gain a deeper understanding
of your own values, of where they come from,

50
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.479
and of how they differ from conceptions of
justice that have exited in the past. I hope

51
00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.699
that you'll come away with clearer thinking
about what justice is and I hope you'll come

52
00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.770
away with skills of expression that allow
you to communicate both in writing and in

53
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.539
speaking your own views about what justice
is and the reasons that underlie your conceptions

54
00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:13.970
of justice. I also hope you'll come away a
better listener that you'll come away with

55
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.250
a deeper civility. It's one of the most importation
virtues of citizenship--the ability to reason,

56
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.460
the ability to communicate, and the ability
to listen to others and their conceptions

57
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.710
of justice.
