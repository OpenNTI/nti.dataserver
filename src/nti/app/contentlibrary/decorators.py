	there is a class naming issue parsing this data right now which is
	parsing the objects coming from the server with Class:
	NTIContentPackage to an object that isn't a descendant of
	NTIUserData. I have no idea why we didn't see this when we were
	testing. The issue has been in the version all along but I think
	maybe it only gets triggered when we head down certain code paths.
	It seems like the main code path was turning these into NTIIDs
	that were then cross referenced into Library/Main but there is a
	merge/update path that isn't doing that and when we resolve a
	class for this data we find a non NTIUserData and that causes
	things to crash. Since this and all prior versions require
	Library/Main to have all accessible ContentPackages anyway I'm
	hoping you can just conditionally externalize those objects as
	NTIIDs for this specific version of the ipad app.
