			of service.</a> As we develop and release new features, we
			must also update our policies to reflect the changes we

  					Some of our users will have opportunities to make
					purchases through the NextThought application.
					When making purchases, users are subject to an end
					user license agreement, which is now included in
					the terms of service agreement and applies only to
					those who make a purchase. Also, we have added a
					provision to the privacy policy that explains how
					we handle personal data that is provided with a
					purchase, such as credit card information.

			<dd>
				<p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; color:#494949 font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">
					We have added some information to our privacy

					these cases we may share applicable personal
					information with the appropriate instructor and/or
					institution.

					Delivering the products and experiences that you
					expect from us requires that we share some of your
					personal information with third-party vendors who
					perform services on our behalf. To clarify this
					interaction, we have added a section to the
					privacy policy to further explain this. Please
					note that these third parties are bound by
					confidentiality agreements and are required not to
					use the information outside of providing services
					requested by us.

					may receive from us, including informational
					emails (such as this one) and promotional emails
					that you may opt out of.
