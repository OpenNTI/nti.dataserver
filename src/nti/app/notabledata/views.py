	"""
	A view of things that might be of interest to the remote user.
	This definition is fixed by the server, so client-applied filters
	are not supported. This view is intended to be used for \"notifications\"
	or as a special type of \"stream\", so sorting is also defined by the server
	as lastModified/descending (newest first) (although you can set ``sortOrder``
	to ``ascending``).

	An addition to the usual ``batchStart`` and ``batchSize`` parameters, you may also
	use:

	batchBefore
		If given, this is the timestamp (floating point number in fractional
		unix seconds, as returned in ``Last Modified``) of the *youngest*
		object to consider returning. Thus, the most efficient way to page through
		this object is to *not* use ``batchStart``, but instead to set ``batchBefore``
		to the timestamp of the *oldest* change in the previous batch (always leaving
		``batchStart`` at zero). Effectively, this defaults to the current time.
		(Note: the next/previous link relations do not currently take this into account.)
