1
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,629
the idea here is really to uh...
understand what are those common

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,589
fundamental drivers

3
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:14,599
that we see

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,069
in our financial crises and banking
crises

5
00:00:18,069 --> 00:00:22,259
how can we diagnose them before castro

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,320
so that&#39;s our

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,149
that&#39;s our that surge and then again
after each of these major

8
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:30,309
uh... later topics will have some up

9
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:32,580
will have some some exercises

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,580
to review the learning

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,070
democrats traverse uh... we&#39;re seeing
very very common drivers across all the

12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:39,780
major

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,160
enough about crises uh...

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,830
and um...

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,719
there are

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,580
ways of predicting

17
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,570
uh... diagnosing them that are very
useful to find

18
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,860
uh... and we&#39;ll talk about uh... the
difference between black swan events

19
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,769
and out what time

20
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,670
uh... did use on that whose uh...
geologist calls a dragon case that&#39;s an

21
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,290
interesting discussion about exogenous
uh... versus indulge in this risks

22
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,720
uh... outlines as early-warning signals
uh... are are very very important that

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,829
universal

24
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:14,149
signal that something

25
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,370
either uh...

26
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,350
units various data or all something
really important has happened the

27
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,220
distribution has shifted

28
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,130
and will show you how to umkc

29
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,780
interpret some of those signals

30
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,530
so let&#39;s dive into systemic risk drivers

31
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,060
banking crises

32
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,650
followed very similar to jack trips

33
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,730
uh... they are are generally driven by
first surges in international capital

34
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,350
flow

35
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,859
uh... and uh...

36
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:43,630
an increase in asset prices

37
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,610
fueled by uh... liquidity

38
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,530
or credits

39
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:53,190
and this is a study from montana road
often dot com reinhart&#39;s com

40
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,719
banking crisis in equal opportunity
manus

41
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,360
and um...

42
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,789
it shows that sort of the proportion of
economies going through a banking crisis

43
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,750
and you can see that time

44
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,788
you know uh... quite often we can get to
uh... you anywhere from

45
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:12,879
fifteen uh... percent or more

46
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,559
of the world economy and the weighted
basis is in some kind of a banking

47
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:19,639
crisis a banking crisis or actually
fairly

48
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,540
fairly common there was a big stretch
after the war when we didn&#39;t have any

49
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,060
right whiskey of a spur of the illusion
that uh... maybe on you know

50
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,269
banking crisis had been solved

51
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:33,159
uh... but obviously they&#39;ve come back
out with a vengeance uh... so you can

52
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,290
see these these pics pikes here

53
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,469
uh... that&#39;s over close to forty percent
of the world economy

54
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:40,929
uh... being in a banking crisis

55
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:46,229
we seeing someone drivers in emerging
markets and uh... developed markets com

56
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:48,850
uh... and uh... financial centers are

57
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,379
uh... especially vulnerable

58
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,929
another interesting correlation

59
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,400
is that financial liberalization capital
mobility

60
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,969
tend to have a destabilizing effect

61
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:03,059
so uh... this is a chart here at that
time

62
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:04,419
roll-off quotes

63
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:08,510
which essentially shows uh... where
they&#39;re plotting their ranking financial

64
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,849
liberalization on the on the on on the
reds um... the red chart

65
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:16,768
and uh... and a m actually banking
crises okay uh... some of countries in

66
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:18,139
banking crisis

67
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:21,389
and you can see that there&#39;s a
relationship when there is a enough when

68
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:23,079
liberalization is going up

69
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,150
uh... banking crises tend to uh...

70
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,379
tend to uh... ten to spike thereafter

71
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:33,999
and i&#39;m quite often this is the case of
sort of uh... process of deregulation

72
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:39,809
uh... while uh... uh... as well of
having more lax supervision

73
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:41,439
so this is again

74
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,040
one of the one of the themes that we
clearly song and the movement more

75
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,179
recent um...

76
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:49,889
maurice in crisis

77
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:54,309
terms of foreign capital inflows it&#39;s
interesting to look at that say the u_s_

78
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:55,929
internet bubble here

79
00:03:55,929 --> 00:03:59,619
foreign capital into equities had peaked
with internet bubble

80
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:04,359
foreign foreign uh... kaplan two
fixed-income markets peaked with the

81
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:06,089
credit a bubble

82
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:07,409
uh... and so that

83
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:12,388
that uh... that surgeon international
apple was certainly a functioned

84
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:13,839
of the sub-prime

85
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:17,539
crisis in the united states

86
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:18,988
we&#39;re having our own

87
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:24,460
obvious that problem around the world
increased levels of debt to g_d_p_

88
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,388
uh... the united states some

89
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:31,280
exceeded three hundred percent total
debt to g_d_p_ and two thousand three

90
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,309
and it&#39;s been going up

91
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,780
uh... pretty much

92
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,239
uh... in the entire developed world and
so that&#39;s uh...

93
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,750
unprecedented level of debt that we need
to

94
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,009
understand how to resolve

95
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:44,339
and there are three ways to

96
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:46,089
really resolved that crisis

97
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:50,639
uh... the first is through economic
growth

98
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,879
and uh...

99
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:56,219
you know hopefully they&#39;ll be strong
economic growth but um...

100
00:04:56,219 --> 00:05:01,680
they rob you know but uh... historical
studies really show that some

101
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,849
uh... strong economic growth falling

102
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:07,089
uh... these kinds of prices tend to be
quite rare

103
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:09,229
big mckinsey study

104
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:13,628
i think from analyzing something like
pop thirty eight crises they found that

105
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,529
in only three cases

106
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:18,569
uh... have uh... you know economies
bounce back

107
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,120
very strongly after a banking crisis

108
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,820
and in each case case those quite unique
and ah... the nigerian puget that was

109
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,699
due to

110
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:26,729
uh...

111
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:28,369
thus covering a lot of or else

112
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,280
oil wealth

113
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,818
and the united states so that the
postwar effect uh... was essentially

114
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:36,530
about uh... well u_s_ you know as the
war dividend or the peace dividend

115
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,770
u_s_ was the only industrialized economy

116
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,969
left with manufacturing capabilities

117
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,560
sold uh... much more common posse is
going to be

118
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,729
uh... area

119
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,810
a decade or so of up

120
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,410
uh... sub par economic

121
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,300
and credit growth

122
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,249
uh... and of course will be a long
stretch for the united states which

123
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:58,449
uh... really since uh... the internet
bubble popped

124
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:00,960
in two thousand

125
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,830
you know really hasn&#39;t shown

126
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,400
signs of sustainable strong

127
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,539
growth right so if we look at

128
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:09,139
though did that

129
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:10,130
blue

130
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:15,610
bars or g_d_p_ has reported but somber
bread bars are just it by the mortgage

131
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,190
equity withdrawals

132
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,029
essentially what people took out

133
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:23,259
using using there are a bit their
housing as as banks

134
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:25,559
and uh... which really wanted to fueling

135
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:30,169
uh... discretionary spending if you took
out mortgage equity withdrawals you&#39;ll

136
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:33,229
see that ah... essentially from the dot
com bust

137
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:37,960
uh... to uh... the housing uh... crisis
that has been no economic growth so

138
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,330
essentially the united states is flat
line

139
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,758
in terms of economic growth for a deck
for well over a decade already

140
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,469
and sensor twelve years of arm

141
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:49,650
you know very very low

142
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,429
uh... growth

143
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,000
uh... so um... you know some of us
having phone sex with someone who said

144
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,809
that uh... i think we&#39;re

145
00:06:56,809 --> 00:07:00,309
uh... we&#39;re going to face something
someone is the as a as japan

146
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:04,090
you know uh... decades of uh... slow
kind of growth while

147
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,250
in the way the u_s_ has already been
considered

148
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,860
uh... a decade of that

149
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,479
that the second

150
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,159
mort severe

151
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,419
uh... papas inflation

152
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:16,280
which is

153
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,779
uh... quite common

154
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:18,999
uh... as well

155
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:20,680
and uh... the most extreme

156
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,730
uh... would be a currency the valuation
followed by a credit default so those

157
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,719
are sort of

158
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,069
three archetypal

159
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:31,840
palce uh... that we need to be able to
look at in terms of

160
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,029
creating test scenarios that we

161
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:38,379
uh... we&#39;re going to look at the stress
testing

162
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:40,090
quote from conroe graphing

163
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,900
by guaranteeing everything

164
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,979
uh... the governments have transformed
the financial crisis into debt

165
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:50,159
crisis who guarantees the government&#39;s
that&#39;s seven two thousand nine

166
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,129
uh... and obviously we&#39;re now dealing

167
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:53,130
with the sovereign crisis
