			# it doesn't actually retry (because commit is inside the __exit__ of a context
			# manager, and when a context manager is exiting normally (not due to an exception),
			# it ignores the return value of __exit__, so the loop
			# doesn't actually loop (i.e., all you can do is raise the exception, you cannot return a value in that scenario,
			# the context manager machinery will ignore it): the normal return statement trumps).
			# Thus, we commit here so that an exception is raised and caught.
			# See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_tm/issues/4
			# Confirmed and filed against 0.4. Probably still the case with 0.5, but our tests
			# pass with or without these next two lines. There's no real harm leaving them in, other than
			# that transaction.commit shows up as being called twice in profiles
