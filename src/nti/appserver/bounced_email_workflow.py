"""
Tools and views for dealing with bounced emails. Bounce notifications go
to an SQS queue where they are processed in batch by running the command
provided in this module. Permanent failures are found and correlated
to user accounts (with substantial logging). The user profile of these
accounts is updated to remove the email, since it is invalid (and continuing to get
bounces for it can make Amazon SES very angry), and links are added to the
user for the application to notice at the next logon time:


.. todo:: It might be possible for the server to detect the update events and
  automatically clear the link. I'm not sure.

.. todo:: The only thing the client can do with these links is DELETE them.
  Would it be useful for them to serve as PUT aliases to update the profile?
  That just seems to complicate the clint which already 'knows' how to update
  the profile (but it could be handy from the command line).

		(e.g., mailbox does not exist).
		In other words, your recipient did not receive your email message, and Amazon SES will not try to resend it."

		transient errors that may truly be transient, particularly MailboxFull, we haven't seen any
