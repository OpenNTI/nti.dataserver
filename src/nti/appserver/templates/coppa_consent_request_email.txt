Dear Parent,

Your child ${profile.realname} has created a free NextThought account
with the username ${user.username} and needs your permission before he
or she can use all of its rich features.

About NextThought
=================

NextThought is a social learning platform that allows students to
interact, communicate and collaborate with others within the content
of their educational materials. Students can access and read materials
online, annotate them, create whiteboards and share notes with their
classmates and teachers.

Your Permission
===============

Before we allow children under the age of 13 to use the social
features of NextThought, we must receive parental consent to collect
some personal information. To permit your child to join the
NextThought community, please review our privacy policies and then
sign and return the attached consent form. Until we receive your
consent, your child can still use some parts of NextThought, such as
reading materials online and making notes for themselves.

Your Child's Information
========================

At NextThought we are committed to providing a safe and secure
environment to support your child's education and appreciate that you
may want to know more about the information we collect.

At registration we saved your child's first name, username, password
and birthday, so he or she could begin to use NextThought. We also
requested an email address, which we hash (or alter) so it can be used
for password resets only. Your child's username is displayed on the
site and should be a pseudonym.

After we receive your signed form, we'll ask your child for his or her
full name, school and email address and make the social features
available to him or her. This information allows us to connect users
to the educational community and to send information about NextThought
to your child.

NextThought Rules, Terms of Service and Privacy
===============================================

Please take a moment to review our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy
and our Children's Privacy Policy for more details about our
information collection and sharing practices. These can all be found
at ${request.application_url}.

You may review or update your child's personal information or request
that we delete his or her account at any time. To do this please send
an email with your child's username to compliance@nextthought.com, and
we will contact you about reviewing or deleting your child's
information.

Sincerely,
NextThought
