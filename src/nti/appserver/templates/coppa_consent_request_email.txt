Dear Parent,

Your child ${profile.realname} has created a free NextThought account
with the username ${user.username} and needs your permission before he
or she can use all of its rich features. To permit your child to join
the NextThought community, please review the information in this
notice and then sign and return the attached consent form using one of
the methods listed on it.

About NextThought
=================

NextThought is a social learning platform that allows students to read
educational materials online, annotate them, chat with their peers,
and share notes and other posts with classmates and teachers.

Your Consent
========================

By registering for the site, your child has access to limited site
features, such as reading materials online and making personal notes.
Before we can enable your child to join the NextThought community, we
need your parental consent to collect some information from your child
and grant him or her access to social features.

By reviewing this email and then signing and sending the attached
form, you permit us to ask for and store your child's full name,
school affiliation, and email address, and to activate the social
features for the account. You also permit us to save your email
address from the form, so that we can notify you of any material
changes to our privacy practices. If desired, you can also opt-in to
receiving additional information about NextThought.

If you do not provide this consent, then we will not collect this
information and your child may continue to use the limited features of
NextThought. If you do not want him or her to have access to
NextThought, even in this limited way, please contact us at the email
address below to delete the account or prohibit further contact.

Our Privacy Practices
========================

At NextThought we are committed to providing a safe, secure
environment to support your child's education and appreciate that you
may want to know more about the information we collect and how we use
it.

Information Provided at Registration
========================

When your child registered for an account, we asked for his or her
name, birthday, username, password, email address, and parent email
address. To minimize data collected from children, we handle this
information in specific ways, as outlined below:

	* Birthday

	We ask for children's birthdays to determine which users need
	parental permission for access to the social features. We do not
	store this information.

	* First Name, Last Name, and Username

	Children's names are never displayed publicly. Instead, each child
	is known by the username he or she creates when registering for an
	account. To protect children's safety and identities, we do not
	permit their usernames to contain their personal names. Therefore,
	we ask for first and last names to conduct a screening. We do not
	save your child's last name after the account is created.

	* Child's Email Address

	We hash (or alter) the email address that a child provides so that
	we can't view it. This altered email address is used only to
	recover a password.

	* Parent's Email Address

	We use this address to send you this notice, and we include it on
	the attached consent form so that we can match your child's
	username to your email address when you submit the form. We delete
	your address after sending you this email.

In short, the only personal information we retain after your child
registers is his or her first name and email address in its altered
form.

Information We Collect for Access to Social Features
========================

After we receive your consent and activate the social features, we
will ask for and store your child's full name, school, and email
address (in unaltered form). Also, we will save your email address
from the consent form in order to notify you of changes to our privacy
practices.

With access to social features your child may be able to fill out
profile information, post blogs and messages, upload photos, and chat
online. Please be aware that any personal information your child
voluntarily posts or sends while using NextThought may be seen by
other users, and take this opportunity to talk with your child about
online safety.

Technical Information
========================

We also collect some technical and usage information via technology,
such as IP addresses and web browsers in use. We collect this
information through cookies and other software technologies. However,
we use it only to support the internal operations of the site.

Sharing Information
========================

We neither rent nor sell personal information to anyone.

We may use third-party providers to perform services on our behalf,
which requires sharing some personal information with them in order to
ensure the proper operation of our site and delivery of our services.

Also, we may share information with those education organizations or
publishers whose content your child interacts with, such as
MATHCOUNTS. We have made reasonable efforts to ensure our vendors and
content providers protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity
of any personal information that we share with them.

Please take a moment to review our Children's Privacy Policy for more
details about our information collection and sharing practices.

Your Child's Account
========================

You may review or delete your child's account at any time. To do this
please send an email with your request to compliance@nextthought.com.

If you have other questions about NextThought or need further
assistance with your child's account, please feel free to contact us.

Sincerely,
NextThought
