Dear Parent,

Your child ${profile.realname} has created a free NextThought account
with the username ${user.username} and needs your permission before he
or she can use all of its rich features. To permit your child to join
the NextThought community, please review the information in this
notice and then sign and return the attached consent form using one of
the methods listed on it.

About NextThought
=================

NextThought is a social learning platform that allows students to read
educational materials online, annotate them, chat with their peers, 
and share notes and other posts with classmates and teachers.

Your Consent
========================

By registering for the site, your child has access to limited site features,
such as reading materials online and making personal notes. Before we can
enable your child to join the NextThought community, we need your parental 
consent to collect some information from your child and grant him or her 
access to social features. 

By reviewing this email and then signing and sending the attached form, you
permit us to ask for and store your child's full name, school affiliation, 
and email address, and to activate the social features for the account. 
You also permit us to save your email address from the form, so that we can 
notify you of any material changes to our privacy practices. If desired, you 
can also opt-in to receiving additional information about NextThought. 

If you do not provide this consent, then we will not collect this information 
and your child may continue to use the limited features of NextThought. If you
do not want him or her to have access to NextThought, even in this limited way, 
please contact us at the email address below to delete the account or prohibit
further contact.

Our Privacy Practices
========================

At NextThought we are committed to providing a safe, secure environment to support
your child's education and appreciate that you may want to know more about the
information we collect and how we use it.

Information Provided at Registration
========================

When your child registered for an account, we asked for his or her name, birthday,
username, password, email address, and parent email address. To minimize data 
collected from children, we handle this information in specific ways, as
outlined below: 	

	* Birthday
	
	We ask for children's birthdays to determine which users need parental permission
	for access to the social features. We do not store this information.

	* First Name, Last Name, and Username

	Children's names are never displayed publicly. Instead, each child is known by 
	the username he or she creates when registering for an account. To protect 
	children's safety and identities, we do not permit their usernames to contain 
	their personal names. Therefore, we ask for first and last names to conduct a 
	screening. We do not save your child's last name after the account is created.
	
	* Child's Email Address
	
	We hash (or alter) the email address that a child provides so that we can't
	view it. This altered email address is used only to recover a password. 
	
	* Parent's Email Address
	We use this address to send you this notice, and we include it on the attached
	consent form so that we can match your child's username to your email address
	when you submit the form. We delete your address after sending you this email.

In short, the only personal information we retain after your child registers is his or 
her first name and email address in its altered form. 

Information We Collect for Access to Social Features
========================

After we receive your consent and activate the social features, we will ask for and 
store your child's full name, school, and email address (in unaltered form). Also, 
we will save your email address from the consent form in order to notify you of 
changes to our privacy practices.

With access to social features your child may be able to fill out profile information, 
post blogs and messages, upload photos, and chat online. Please be aware that any
personal information your child voluntarily posts or sends while using NextThought 
may be seen by other users, and take this opportunity to talk with your child 
about online safety.

Technical Information
========================

We also collect some technical and usage information via technology, such as IP 
addresses and web browsers in use. We collect this information through cookies and 
other software technologies. However, we use it only to support the internal 
operations of the site.

Sharing Information
========================

We neither rent nor sell personal information to anyone.

We may use third-party providers to perform services on our behalf, which requires 
sharing some personal information with them in order to ensure the proper operation
of our site and delivery of our services. 

Also, we may share information with those education organizations or publishers 
whose content your child interacts with, such as MATHCOUNTS. We have made reasonable 
efforts to ensure our vendors and content providers protect the confidentiality, 
security, and integrity of any personal information that we share with them. 

Please take a moment to review our Children's Privacy Policy for more details about 
our information collection and sharing practices.

Your Child's Account
========================

You may review or delete your child's account at any time. To do this please send an
email with your request to compliance@nextthought.com. 
		
If you have other questions about NextThought or need further assistance with your child's 
account, please feel free to contact us.
