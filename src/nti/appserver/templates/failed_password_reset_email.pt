	</head>
	<body>
		<p>Hello.</p>

		<p>
			You are receiving this notification because you (or someone pretending
			to be you) requested that the password for a NextThought account
			be reset. Unfortunately, we do not have a registration for that
			account and this email address, and so the reset failed.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you were expecting this email, please try again with the username
			and email address of your registered account.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you did not request this reset, you can safely
			disregard this email.
		</p>
		<p>
		For help, you can email us at <a href="mailto:support@nextthought.com">support@nextthought.com</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Sincerely, <br />
			NextThought
