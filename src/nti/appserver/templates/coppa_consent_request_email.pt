		<p>Dear Parent,</p>
		<p>
			Your child <span class="tterm" tal:content="options/profile/realname">Justin</span> has created a free NextThought account
			with the username <span class="tterm" tal:content="options/user/username">mathdude217</span> and needs your permission before he
			or she can use all of its rich features.
		</p>

		<h1>About NextThought</h1>
		<p>
			NextThought is a social learning platform that allows students to
			interact, communicate and collaborate with others within the content
			of their educational materials. Students can access and read materials
			online, annotate them, create whiteboards and share notes with their
			classmates and teachers.
		</p>

		<h1>Your Permission</h1>
		<p>
			Before we allow children under the age of 13 to use the social
			features of NextThought, we must receive parental consent to collect
			some personal information. To permit your child to join the
			NextThought community, please review our privacy policies and then
			sign and return the attached consent form. Until we receive your
			consent, your child can still use some parts of NextThought, such as
			reading materials online and making notes for themselves.
		</p>
		<h1>Your Child's Information</h1>
		<p>
			At NextThought we are committed to providing a safe and secure
			environment to support your child's education and appreciate that you
			may want to know more about the information we collect.
		</p>
		<p>
			At registration we saved your child's first name, username, password
			and birthday, so he or she could begin to use NextThought. We also
			requested an email address, which we hash (or alter) so it can be used
			for password resets only. Your child's username is displayed on the
			site and should be a pseudonym.
		</p>
		<p>
			After we receive your signed form, we'll ask your child for his or her
			full name, school and email address and make the social features
			available to him or her. This information allows us to connect users
			to the educational community and to send information about NextThought
			to your child.
		</p>

		<h1>NextThought Rules, Terms of Service and Privacy</h1>
		<p>
			Please take a moment to review our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy
			and our Children's Privacy Policy for more details about our
			information collection and sharing practices. These can all be found
			at <a href="http://nextthought.com"
				  tal:attributes="href request/application_url"
				  tal:content="request/application_url">http://nextthought.com</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may review or update your child's personal information
			or request that we delete his or her account at any time.
			To do this please send an email with your child's username
			to <a href="mailto:compliance@nextthought.com">compliance@nextthought.com</a>.,
			and we will contact you about reviewing or deleting your
			child's information.
		</p>

		<p>
			Sincerely, <br />
			NextThought
