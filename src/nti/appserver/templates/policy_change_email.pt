		<p>Dear Participant,</p>
		<p>
			Thank you for being part of the NextThought community. We
			are writing today to let you know about updates to our
			<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1W9R8s1jIHWTp38gvacXOStsfmUz5TjyDYYy3CVJ2SmM">privacy
			policy</a>
			and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1rM40we-bbPNvq8xivEKhkoLE7wmIETmO4kerCYmtISM">terms
			of service.</a> As we develop and release new features, we
			must also update our policies to reflect the changes we
			are making, and we want to take this opportunity to
			further clarify how we use the information that you
			entrust to us.
		</p>

		<h2>Summary of Updates</h2>

		<dl style="margin-left: 30px">
			<dt style="font-weight: bold">Information Provided with a Purchase</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
  					Some of our users will have opportunities to make
					purchases through the NextThought application.
					When making purchases, users are subject to an end
					user license agreement, which is now included in
					the terms of service agreement and applies only to
					those who make a purchase. Also, we have added a
					provision to the privacy policy that explains how
					we handle personal data that is provided with a
					purchase, such as credit card information.
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt style="font-weight: bold">Information Shared with Institutions</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					We have added some information to our privacy
					policy for our users who access NextThought
					through academic or sponsoring institutions. In
					these cases we may share applicable personal
					information with the appropriate instructor and/or
					institution.
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt style="font-weight: bold">Information Provided through Technology</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					We have added information to our privacy policy to
					better describe how we use the information
					collected via technology. We now differentiate
					between information used for internal operations
					and data that we apply to the learning experience.
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt style="font-weight: bold">Third Party Providers</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Delivering the products and experiences that you
					expect from us requires that we share some of your
					personal information with third-party vendors who
					perform services on our behalf. To clarify this
					interaction, we have added a section to the
					privacy policy to further explain this. Please
					note that these third parties are bound by
					confidentiality agreements and are required not to
					use the information outside of providing services
					requested by us.
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt style="font-weight: bold">Communications from NextThought</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					To provide better transparency about our
					communication practices, we have updated the
					privacy policy to describe the notices that you
					may receive from us, including informational
					emails (such as this one) and promotional emails
					that you may opt out of.
				</p>
			</dd>
		</dl>

		<p>
		At NextThought we care about your privacy and want to keep you
		informed of changes to our service. These changes are effective as of
		May 1, 2013, and we encourage you to read the updated policies
		carefully. If you have any questions, please contact us at
		<a href="mailto:compliance@nextthought.com">compliance@nextthought.com.</a>
