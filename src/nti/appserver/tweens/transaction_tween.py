"""
A tween that begins and ends transactions around its handler. This is initially
very similar to :mod:`pyramid_tm`, but with the following changes:

* The transaction is rolled back if the request is deemed to be
  side-effect free (this has intimate knowledge of the paths that do
  not follow the HTTP rules for a GET being side-effect free; however,
  if you are a GET request and you violate the rules by having
  side-effects, you can set the environment key
  ``nti.request_had_transaction_side_effects`` to ``True``)

* Logging is added to account for the time spent in aborts and commits.
