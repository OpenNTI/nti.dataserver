	Given a stream to our COPPA pdf, manipulate the fields to include the given data,

	This process is intimately tied to the structure of the PDF. If the PDF changes, then this
	process will have to be (slightly) recalculated. Thus this method is littered with assertions.

	This process depends on using standard PDF fonts, or having the
	entire font embedded, otherwise characters not contained in the
	PDF will fail to render (will render as square boxes). Our starter
	PDF includes all the ASCII characters, except the lowercase 'j',
	which causes text strings to break up. It has also been run
	through Acrobat Pro to be sure that the fields we want to replace
	are in Helvetica (Bold), and that this font (a standard font) is
	not subsetted, so that we can render 'j'. Acrobat Pro is also used to add the
	clickable link, which doesn't make it through printing from Word.

	The best way to get the document out of Word is to Print, use the
	PDF option of the Print dialog and 'Save as Adobe PDF', and
	'Smallest File Size' which puts it right into Acrobat. This is the
	only way to achieve the ~40K file size (otherwise you get 800K).
	When using the PDF Optimizer, image optimizations should be
	unchecked; having it checked seems to embed 300K of Color Space
	data. Also, the best results seem to come from simply unembedding all the
	fonts and setting compatibility to PDF 1.3.
