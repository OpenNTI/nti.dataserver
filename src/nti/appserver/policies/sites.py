"""
Component registries and site managers for specific sites.

These use :mod:`z3c.baseregistry` to be configurable using ZCML. Thus,
for each constant declared here, there is a corresponding ZCML file
that registers the constant as a utility with a matching name. Any configuration
for that site belongs in a ``registerIn`` directive within that ZCML file. These
files then have to be referenced from the main configuration file.

When creating a site manager, you *MUST* use :const:`BASEADULT` or :const:`MATHCOUNTS`
in its base chain. You do not (should not) create the site object
in this module.

	ZCA cleans up the base registry on testing cleanup. It does so by

	This means that our site objects no longer have the right resolution order
	(which is cached when bases are set). This in turn means that new
	components derived from them can wind up with the wrong resolution
	order and duplicate registrations (this manifests itself as seeing
	certain event listeners run twice, etc.) The solution is for us to also
	``__init__`` our site objects. This works because the order of cleanups is maintained
	and so we re-init after ZCA's base registry has re-inited.
