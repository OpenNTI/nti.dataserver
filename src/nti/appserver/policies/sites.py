	"""
	ZCA cleans up the base registry on testing cleanup. It does so by
	leaving the base registry object in place and swizzling out its internals
	by calling ``__init__`` again.

	This means that our site objects no longer have the right resolution order
	(which is cached when bases are set). This in turn means that new
	components derived from them can wind up with the wrong resolution
	order and duplicate registrations (this manifests itself as seeing
	certain event listeners run twice, etc.) The solution is for us to also
	``__init__`` our site objects. This works because the order of cleanups is maintained
	and so we re-init after ZCA's base registry has re-inited.
