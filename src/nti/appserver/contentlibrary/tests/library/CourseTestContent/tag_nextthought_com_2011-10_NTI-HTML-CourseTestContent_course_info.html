Is a law just because it was made through a fair process, for instance by majority vote? Or is a law just because of its substance, because it respects human rights, promotes the greatest good for the greatest number, or establishes a fair system for the interaction of voluntary agents? This course explores these questions in the context of Greek and Roman law. The Greeks and Romans were the first western societies to confront these questions directly, and more importantly they tried to implement their ideas through political institutions. The focus of this course is on law, because law is the meeting point between the theory and practice of justice. With Aristotle&#8217;s Politics as our principal guide, this course will follow the development of justice throughout the Greco-Roman experience. </p><div class="subsection title" id="a0000000004" ntiid="tag:nextthought.com,2011-10:NTI-HTML-CourseTestContent.grading">Grading</div> <a name="873bd5e59cff02d1c5ef5cb89da2c35d"></a> <table class="tabular"> <tbody><tr> <td style="text-align:left"><a name="ec36eecb212798bfc86076f1759b5824"></a> <p class="par" id="ec36eecb212798bfc86076f1759b5824"> Participation </p></td> <td style="text-align:right"><a name="0fe9e8b5730588f8cefe9a083b8689e4"></a> <p class="par" id="0fe9e8b5730588f8cefe9a083b8689e4"> 10% </p></td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align:left"><a name="20d8a9abeb93b0614c63156654fcb5c7"></a> <p class="par" id="20d8a9abeb93b0614c63156654fcb5c7">Short Paper </p></td> <td style="text-align:right"><a name="0fe9e8b5730588f8cefe9a083b8689e4.1"></a> <p class="par" id="0fe9e8b5730588f8cefe9a083b8689e4.1"> 10% </p></td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align:left"><a name="d947a8f4ecff0bbdb392e3d2d86cc851"></a> <p class="par" id="d947a8f4ecff0bbdb392e3d2d86cc851">Long Paper </p></td> <td style="text-align:right"><a name="e21e329f0f75c2044ef8414972039d76"></a> <p class="par" id="e21e329f0f75c2044ef8414972039d76"> 20% </p></td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align:left"><a name="6e307644b87bf0a6cfe363dea2caf5ba"></a> <p class="par" id="6e307644b87bf0a6cfe363dea2caf5ba">Mid-term </p></td> <td style="text-align:right"><a name="5ea10588ad6376593afdeb7b30bc1a09"></a> <p class="par" id="5ea10588ad6376593afdeb7b30bc1a09"> 25% </p></td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align:left"><a name="beae421a14a34f831c113f61323d1ab3"></a> <p class="par" id="beae421a14a34f831c113f61323d1ab3">Final </p></td> <td style="text-align:right"><a name="1f89474ddc8b2d428ecd10849d3fa9b2"></a> <p class="par" id="1f89474ddc8b2d428ecd10849d3fa9b2"> 35% </p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&#160;</td> </tr> </tbody></table><a name="fb5e3e8412889dfd79cde6744b1ce142"></a> <p class="par" id="fb5e3e8412889dfd79cde6744b1ce142">Attendance is required and participation is graded.
