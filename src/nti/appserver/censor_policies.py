	Attempts to locate a censoring policy, appropriate for the creator
	of the target object and the location in which it is being created.

	.. note:: We do not really have much sense of roles yet, but when we do
		this needs to take those into account (i.e., a teacher might be able to get
		away with more than a student). Currently, we just take some broad-based
		things into account, such as user age (coppa status).

	The current policy is simple: profanity is filtered for everyone
	by replacing it with family friendly symbols. For adult users, this policy can be
	turned off in certain content units.

	The event listener works by re-dispatching based on creator and location. In effect
	it turns one sort of event dispatch into another sort. The original event dispatch
	was name-based (the adapter has to be named for the field), and this dispatcher
	needs to be registered by name. The adapters this dispatcher finds based on creator and location,
	on the other hand, SHOULD NOT be registered by name. That is implicit in the first
	dispatch.

	.. note:: This falls over when we have objects that can be edited by
		someone besides their creator. Then we would need to be checking the
		current authenticated principal instead of the creator, or the one
		that is the most restrictive, or both.

	:keyword list site_names: If given, this is an ordered list of the active sites
		we should consider when looking for site-wide policies. It can
		be passed by another adapter factory that has this context information
		not dependent on the current request.
