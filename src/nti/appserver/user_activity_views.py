	The /Activity view for a particular user.

	This view returns a collection of activity for the specified user, across
	the entire site (similar to a RecursiveUserGeneratedData query using the Root
	ntiid.) One difference is that this URL never returns a 404 response, even when initially
	empty. Another is that the ``MeOnly`` filter is implicit, and refers not to the calling
	user but the user who's data is being accessed.

	The contents fully support the same sorting and paging parameters as
	the UGD views with a few exceptions:

	* The definition for a ``TopLevel`` object is changed to mean one that has never been a
	  child in a thread (instead of just one who is not currently a child in a thread) (where possible).

	* Assessed questions are always excluded (unless you specifically include them; their
	  ACL only allows their owner/creator to see them anyway).
