	Adjust the reported ``TopicCount`` to reflect publication status/security.

		and the data in order to security check each one. Something
		will have to be done about this. We rationalize its existence
		now by assuming our other scalability problems are worse and we'll
		have to fix them all eventually; this won't be an issue in the short term.

	Also adjusts the ``NewestDescendant`` field for the same reason, setting it to
	``None`` if it shouldn't be visible. This is something of a worse hack
	as there is not a fallback object to put in its place (that would require searching
	all topic posts, which I'm not willing to do); since we are already
	walking through topics, we simply through the newest topic there. However,
	sorting is still based on the newest descendant, whatever it may be. In
	real world practice, this is unlikely to be either noticed (if there is *any*
	posting activity at all as there will almost always be a newer comment)
	or a problem. (To minimize this, we use the ``lastModified`` time of the topic,
