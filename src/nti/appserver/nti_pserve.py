"""
A hack to help us ensure that we are loading and monkey-patching
the entire system before Pyramid loads: loading Pyramid's ``pserve``
loads many Pyramid modules, including :mod:`pyramid.traversal`, which
in turn loads :mod:`repoze.lru` and allocates real, non-recursive
thread locks. These are not compatible with gevent and eventually
lead to a hang if we re-enter a greenlet that wants to acquire one
of these locks while a previous greenlet already has it.
