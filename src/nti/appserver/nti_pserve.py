"""
A hack to help us ensure that we are loading and monkey-patching
the entire system before pyramid loads: loading pyramid's pserve
loads many pyramid modules, including pyramid.traversal, which
in turn loads repoze.lru and allocates real, non-recursive
thread locks. These are not compatible with gevent and eventually
lead to a hang if we re-enter a greenlet that wants to acquire one
of these locks while a previous greenlet already has it.
