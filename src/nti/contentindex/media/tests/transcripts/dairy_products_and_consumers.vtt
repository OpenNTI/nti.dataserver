00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:02.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Most of my kin rely almost

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.104 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
exclusively on low-carb

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:05.205 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
diets to lose weight,

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:06.607 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
and when they go on a

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:07.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
low-carb diet they replace

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:09.343 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
some of their carb-calories

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:10.878 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
with beef and yogurt.

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:12.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
For my family,

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.181 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
this means that meat and yogurt

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.216 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
played an important role in

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:17.184 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
maintaining a healthy weight.

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:18.852 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
This means that two foods

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:19.987 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
produced from dairy cattle:

00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:21.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
beef and yogurt,

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.123 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
are essential to them

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
for a slim figure.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.293 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
But are they representative

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:27.361 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
of all Americans?

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:29.296 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
What percent of Americans who

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:31.498 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
use low-carb diets increase

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:33.033 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
their meat and yogurt

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.568 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
consumption when losing weight?

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:36.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
That is a question worth asking,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
and I answered

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:38.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
it using a survey.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
This lecture is about how to

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.442 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
conduct consumer research using

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
a survey or consumer experiment.

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:46.480 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
We are focusing

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.581 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
on beef and yogurt,

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:48.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
but the general survey

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:50.284 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
methods can be applied to

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:51.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
any food or product.

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:53.620 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
The first step in administering

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
this survey was to recruit a

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.291 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
group of survey respondents

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:58.625 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
who were representative

00:00:58.625 --> 00:00:59.693 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
of all Americans.

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:01.495 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
This was the easy part,

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:02.629 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
as I could simply pay a

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:03.697 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
marketing firm to

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:05.399 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
administer the survey online,

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.200 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
and they would ensure a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
representative sample.

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:10.737 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
A sample is representative if

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.006 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
its demographics match those of

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
the population you are studying.

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:16.009 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
In my case,

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
I was studying

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.211 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
Americans in general.

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.846 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
In many ways my

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:21.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
sample was representative.

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:22.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
For example,

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:24.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
13% of the American population

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
is 65 years of age or older,

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:29.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
and 13% of my survey respondents

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
were also 65 or older.

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:34.428 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
This survey was not perfectly

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:35.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
representative though,

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.997 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
because it didn't account

00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:37.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
for people who don't

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
use the internet and

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:40.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
don't like taking surveys,

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
but it is a good

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
sample nevertheless.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.006 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Allow me to give a rather

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:47.541 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
humorous description of a

00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:48.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
"representative sample".

00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:51.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
This American Life is one of the

00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:52.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
most popular podcasts,

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:54.114 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and in their episode titled

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
'A Little Bit of Knowledge',

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:58.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NPR journalist Alex Blumberg

00:01:58.251 --> 00:01:59.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
told a story about

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:01.321 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
what he thought the

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.723 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
Nielson Ratings were.

00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:03.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
For those of you

00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:04.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
who do not know,

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the Nielson Ratings are how we

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.061 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
measure the popularity of

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.096 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
television shows.

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:10.864 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
They are statistics compiled by

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:12.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
the Nielson Company.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
They select a group of

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
representative Americans

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and ask them to record all

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.971 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
the programs they watch

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
over a period of time.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.975 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
These Americans are selected so

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
that all demographics of

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Americans, meaning all ages,

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
genders, geographic locations,

00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:28.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
etc, are captured.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:30.083 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
And they are captured

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:31.485 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
in a way that allows us

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:32.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
to infer the viewing

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:33.954 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
behaviors of all Americans.

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:35.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Well, Blumberg thought

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:37.491 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
the company was

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:38.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
only acquiring viewing

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.627 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
information on families with

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:42.229 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
the last name of Nielson.

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:45.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
He thought that was why it was

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.099 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
called the Nielson ratings.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.702 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Blumberg just assumed there was

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
one explanation for this,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and in this explanation he

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
reveals his intuitive grasp of

00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:55.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
a representative sample.

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
He remarks: "I think I figured

00:02:58.345 --> 00:02:59.913 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
they had done some research and

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:01.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
found that the name Nielsen,

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:02.816 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
because it was a common

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:04.751 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
name maybe, and it seemed

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:05.619 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
to cut across class

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:07.287 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
and economic lines,

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:09.556 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
actually came pretty close to a

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:10.924 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
representative sample."

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:13.293 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
Now back to my survey

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:14.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
on low-carb diets.

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.495 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
After acquiring

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:16.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
a representative sample,

00:03:16.797 --> 00:03:19.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the next step was to control

00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
as much as you can,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
 which means with surveys that

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:23.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
since you are in charge of

00:03:23.737 --> 00:03:24.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
writing the questions,

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.673 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
you control the language used

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:28.375 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and the ordering of questions

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.077 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
such that subjects are really

00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:31.645 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
answering the questions you

00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:33.213 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
want them to address.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I did this by first asking

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:37.017 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
a series of questions

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:38.518 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
that filtered out all the

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:40.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
individuals who have not

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:41.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
and do not rely upon

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:43.056 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
low-carb diets for weight loss.

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Thus, I controlled for the

00:03:45.926 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
fact that some people

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
have never been on a

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:49.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
low-carb diet.

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:51.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Then, I asked this very simple

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:53.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
question: When you are

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.734 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
on a low-carb diet,

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.103 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
how does your consumption

00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:58.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of the following foods change?

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:01.408 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
I then listed beef, pork,

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:03.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
chicken/turkey as a single

00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:07.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
group, milk, yogurt, cheese,

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:09.316 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
eggs, vegetables, sugar

00:04:09.316 --> 00:04:10.817 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
excluding those found

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:13.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
naturally in fruits, and fruits.

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:15.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
And I then asked whether

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:17.457 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
they consume less of,

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
consume the same amount of,

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.129 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
or consume more of each food.

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:24.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I controlled for the fact that

00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:26.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
some people can be wishy-washy

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:27.367 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
in their answers.

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:29.002 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
I wanted them to have to choose

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:31.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
between eating more, less,

00:04:31.138 --> 00:04:32.472 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
or the same amount.

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:34.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
There was no I don't know,

00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:35.642 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
category for them

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:36.443 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
to choose from.

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:39.112 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Now, sometimes researchers do

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
want consumers to have the

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.314 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
option of responding with

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:42.816 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
"I don't know",

00:04:42.816 --> 00:04:44.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
but since I could only

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:45.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
afford a sample of less than

00:04:45.886 --> 00:04:46.887 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
400 subjects,

00:04:46.887 --> 00:04:48.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I needed those subjects to

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
state a position clearly.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Had I allowed for "I don't know"

00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:54.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
answers, I might have had only a

00:04:54.728 --> 00:04:56.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
few dozen of responses to my

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
main question of interest.

00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:59.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
As you might expect,

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
people's responses will be

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:02.802 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
influenced by the order

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
of the foods listed.

00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:06.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
People might be more

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:07.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
inclined to choose some of

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:08.742 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
the first four options,

00:05:08.742 --> 00:05:10.710 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
simply because they do not want

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
to read all the options.

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:15.248 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Perhaps they might say they eat

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:16.583 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
more beef on low-carb diets

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:18.518 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
simply because it was the first

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:19.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
item to choose from.

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:21.721 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
This would bias the survey,

00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:23.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and whenever there is a factor

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:25.492 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
embedded in the survey that

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:26.760 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
biases subjects' answers,

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
the solution is to randomize it.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Randomize what you

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:31.565 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
cannot control.

00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
In this case, we randomly

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.302 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
varied the order of

00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:36.503 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
the foods listed.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:38.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Beef appeared first on the

00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:39.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
survey the same amount

00:05:39.573 --> 00:05:41.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
times as pork,

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.943 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
chicken/turkey, milk,

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:43.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
or any other food.

00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:46.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
The precise ordering of the food

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:48.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
items for any one survey

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
was randomly determined

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
by a computer.

00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:53.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So if people do tend to select

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the first items on the list,

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
this randomization will not

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.092 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
allow this tendency to bias

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:00.794 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
responses in favor of

00:06:00.794 --> 00:06:02.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
one food or another.

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:04.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
What did I learn

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:05.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
from the survey?

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:07.934 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Of the 388 individuals who took

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:12.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the survey 197 had gone on a

00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:14.174 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
low-carb diet and could tell us

00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:15.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
how their food patterns changed.

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:18.044 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
The graph here shows,

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.213 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
of the 197 individuals,

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
how many consume more,

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:25.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
less, or the same amount

00:06:25.018 --> 00:06:26.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
of each food while

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:28.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
on the diet.

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:29.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
More people decreased pork

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:31.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
and beef consumption

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:32.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
than those who increased it,

00:06:32.926 --> 00:06:34.127 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
but the reverse was

00:06:34.127 --> 00:06:35.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
true for chicken/turkey.

00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:38.131 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
Some people reduced chicken

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:40.066 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
consumption on a low-carb diet,

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.201 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
but many more

00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:42.535 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
increase consumption.

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:44.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
What about yogurt?

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:47.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
More people ate more yogurt when

00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:48.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
they went on a low-carb diet

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
than those who ate less.

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:52.679 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
This suggests that yogurt but

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:54.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
not beef is an important

00:06:54.648 --> 00:06:56.316 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
complement to low-carb diets.

00:06:56.316 --> 00:06:58.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
The most interesting result is

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:01.054 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
that the majority (68%)

00:07:01.054 --> 00:07:02.656 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
increased their vegetable

00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:03.857 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
consumption and

00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:05.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
only 6% consumed less.

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
That has to make

00:07:07.327 --> 00:07:09.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
nutritionists happy!

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:10.864 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
Surprisingly,

00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:12.065 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
more people increased their

00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:13.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
consumption of fruits than those

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:16.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
who either decreased or consumed

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:18.004 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
the same amount of fruit.

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:19.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
I say this is surprising because

00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:22.108 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
fruit contains many sugars,

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
which are certainly carbs!

00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:24.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
Why am I telling

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:25.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
you about this survey?

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:27.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
Because in our effort to

00:07:27.714 --> 00:07:29.516 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
understand modern agriculture

00:07:29.516 --> 00:07:31.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
we want to do more

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:32.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
than learn how farmers

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:33.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
raise crops and animals.

00:07:33.887 --> 00:07:35.388 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
We want to understand the

00:07:35.388 --> 00:07:36.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
interactions between

00:07:36.523 --> 00:07:37.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
farmers and consumers,

00:07:37.724 --> 00:07:39.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and thus we want to know how

00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:41.661 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
consumers think about food.

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:45.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Between 2007 and 2013,

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
sales of Greek yogurt a yogurt

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:49.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
higher in protein than regular

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:51.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
yogurt went from 1% of the

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:53.473 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
yogurt market to 36%!

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Was it just the taste?

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:56.676 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
Probably not.

00:07:56.676 --> 00:07:58.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
My survey showed that sales of

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.146 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Greek yogurt tend to increase

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
when people go on a low-carb

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
diet, and enthusiasm for

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:05.819 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
low-carb diet has not

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:06.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
waned in the

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:07.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
last 10 years.

00:08:07.754 --> 00:08:09.556 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
One of the hardest parts of a

00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:10.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
low-carb diet is finding a

00:08:10.757 --> 00:08:12.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
variety of foods to eat,

00:08:12.092 --> 00:08:13.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
since bread is now

00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:14.394 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
out of the picture.

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:15.929 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
Greek yogurt offers

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:17.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
a alternative,

00:08:17.297 --> 00:08:18.331 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
and consumers adopted

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.332 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
it eagerly.

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.534 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
I think this an important

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:23.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
insight about consumer

00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:25.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
preferences for dairy foods.

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:26.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
To understand modern

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:28.074 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
agriculture we must

00:08:28.074 --> 00:08:29.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
understand modern consumers.

00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:31.778 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Consider another example.

00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:34.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I once conducted a telephone

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.782 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
survey of more than 1,000

00:08:35.782 --> 00:08:37.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
Americans to gauge their

00:08:37.384 --> 00:08:38.818 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
attitudes about the well-being

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:40.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
of farm animals.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Two of the questions I asked

00:08:42.422 --> 00:08:45.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
are: 1. Do you agree

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:47.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
or disagree with the

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
following statement?

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
Low meat prices are more

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
important than the

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:52.899 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
well-being of farm animals.

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:57.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
2. Do you agree or disagree with

00:08:57.771 --> 00:08:59.272 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
the following statements?

00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:01.341 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
The average American believes

00:09:01.341 --> 00:09:02.142 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
that low meat prices are more

00:09:02.142 --> 00:09:03.743 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
important than the well-being

00:09:03.743 --> 00:09:04.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
of farm animals.

00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:06.946 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
This also is a dairy issue,

00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:08.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
as just like every other

00:09:08.648 --> 00:09:09.916 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
livestock industry,

00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:11.084 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
the dairy industry is

00:09:11.084 --> 00:09:11.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
under the watch of

00:09:11.985 --> 00:09:13.520 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
animal welfare advocates,

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
and periodically scrutinized for

00:09:15.989 --> 00:09:17.724 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
how calves and dairy cattle are

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:19.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
raised, especially since

00:09:19.259 --> 00:09:20.493 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
some dairy calves are

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:21.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
raised for veal.

00:09:21.461 --> 00:09:23.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Here is what we found.

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:25.465 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
When we asked if they believe

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:27.567 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
that low meat prices are more

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:28.735 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
important than the well-being

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
of farm animals,

00:09:30.003 --> 00:09:31.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
only 16% agreed.

00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:34.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
That is, most people told us

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
that preventing animal suffering

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:37.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
is more important to them,

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.679 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
than low meat prices,

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:42.449 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
but when we asked them to

00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:43.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
speculate about what the

00:09:43.817 --> 00:09:45.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
average American believes,

00:09:45.185 --> 00:09:47.086 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
the percent agreeing went

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:50.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
from 16% to 68%!

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:51.357 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
Think about that!

00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:52.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
Most people were

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:53.893 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
basically saying,

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:55.662 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
"I personally care more

00:09:55.662 --> 00:09:56.996 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
about the well-being of

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:58.097 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
farm animals, but the

00:09:58.097 --> 00:09:59.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
average American doesn't."

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
That is like saying most

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:03.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
people are above

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:04.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
average in height.

00:10:04.137 --> 00:10:05.472 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
Mathematically, it just

00:10:05.472 --> 00:10:06.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
can't be true.

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:08.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
It is impossible for both of

00:10:08.408 --> 00:10:09.876 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
these percentages to be true,

00:10:09.876 --> 00:10:13.012 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
so subjects are telling lies to

00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:15.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
at least one of the questions.

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I believe they were probably

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.718 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
overstating the degree to which

00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:20.253 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
they really take the well-being

00:10:20.253 --> 00:10:22.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of farm animals into account

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:23.456 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
when purchasing food.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Though the student

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:26.125 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
may find this surprising,

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:27.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
psychologists would not,

00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:29.496 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
as they have consistently found

00:10:29.496 --> 00:10:30.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
that most people rate themselves

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:32.499 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
above average on almost

00:10:32.499 --> 00:10:34.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
everything, which mathematically

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:35.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
is impossible.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.570 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
For those who

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:38.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
know statistics this assumes

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:40.507 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
most people interpret the

00:10:40.507 --> 00:10:41.708 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
average to be the median.

00:10:41.708 --> 00:10:45.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
This is referred to as the

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:46.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Lake Wobegon Effect,

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.648 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
from NPR's A Prairie Home

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:49.949 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
Companion where a

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:51.217 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
fictitious town of Lake Wobegon

00:10:51.217 --> 00:10:52.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
is described as,

00:10:52.619 --> 00:10:54.154 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
all the women are strong,

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:56.022 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
all the men are good looking,

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:57.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
and all the children

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
are above average.

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
What we believe these

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.028 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
questions tell us is that you

00:11:02.028 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
cannot measure how much

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
people really care about the

00:11:05.298 --> 00:11:06.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
well-being of farm animals

00:11:06.566 --> 00:11:08.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
by directly asking them.

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:09.936 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
One must infer it

00:11:09.936 --> 00:11:11.771 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
indirectly, say, by their

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:12.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
purchasing behavior.

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.440 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
That is, you can't simply

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.742 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
ask consumers whether

00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:16.976 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
they would pay 10% higher

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:18.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
prices for cage-free eggs.

00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:20.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Too many would

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:22.115 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
incorrectly answer yes.

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:24.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
You must observe whether

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
they actually do so.

00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:27.620 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
The same goes for other issues,

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
like milk produced using

00:11:29.589 --> 00:11:31.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
rBST and sustainable beef.

00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:34.060 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
For this reason researchers

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
often use consumer experiments

00:11:36.396 --> 00:11:37.864 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
instead of surveys,

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:39.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
where they place subjects in a

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:40.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
scenario where they must

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:42.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
make real purchasing

00:11:42.402 --> 00:11:44.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
decisions with real money.

00:11:44.304 --> 00:11:46.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
This and the following two

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:47.740 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
lectures are all about how to

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.542 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
conduct consumer experiments,

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.544 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
using as an example

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.246 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
recent research on consumer

00:11:53.246 --> 00:11:55.114 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
preferences for milk.

00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:58.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Much about designing experiments

00:11:58.184 --> 00:11:59.852 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
is similar to a survey.

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:01.254 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
You must choose a

00:12:01.254 --> 00:12:02.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
representative sample,

00:12:02.322 --> 00:12:04.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
control your questions

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
intelligently, and randomize

00:12:05.992 --> 00:12:07.193 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
what you can't control.

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:09.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
However, experiments require

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:10.463 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
more than that.

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:12.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
They require auctions,

00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:13.733 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and not the type of auction

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:26.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
you are used to.
