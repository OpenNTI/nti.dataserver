                "Solution": "If we let n represent the number of nickels, d represent the number of dimes, and q represent the number of quarters, then we can write the equation $n + d + q = 37$. Since we also know that $n = 4 + d$ and $q = 2 + n$, it follows that $q = 6 + d$. By substitution into the first equation, we get (4+d) $+ d + (6 + d) = 37$. Simplifying yields $10 + 3d = 37$. Subtracting 10 from both sides and dividing by 3, we get $d = 9$, which means that there must be 9 dimes. There are $4 + 9 = 13$ nickels and $2 + 13 = 15$ quarters. To verify these numbers, we add 13+9+ 15, which does indeed equal 37.",

                "Solution": "The triangle formed by connecting the centers of the circles is an equilateral triangle with side length equal to the radius of each circle. Since the diameter of each circle is 8 cm, the radius is 4 cm. If we drop a perpendicular from one vertex of the triangle to the opposite side, it will bisect the side. This gives us two 30-60-90 triangles. We know that the length of the hypotenuse of one of these triangles is 4 cm and the length of the short leg is 2 cm. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the longer leg, h (for height), as follows: $22 + h2$ =42 $\\rightarrow$ 4 +h2= $16 \\rightarrow h2 = 16 - 4 \\rightarrow h2 = 12 \\rightarrow h =$ $\\surd$12 $\\rightarrow$ h = 2$\\surd$3. Using this height and a base of 4 cm, we now find that the area of the equilateral triangle is (1/2)$\\times$4$\\times$2$\\surd$3 = 4$\\surd$3 cm2. A nice formula to remember for the area of an equilateral triangle with side length s is A = \u300cs^2 root 3 over 4\u300d. The area of the triangle in this problem is then 42$\\surd$3/4 = 4$\\surd$3 cm2.",

Segment AB is 1.5 times the length of segment XW, so segment AD should be 1.5 times the length of segment ZW. This leads to the equation 1.5(x $+ 1) = 3x - 6$, which is equivalent to 1.5x + 1.5= 3x-6. Subtracting 1.5x from both sides and adding 6 to both sides, we get $7.5 = 1.5x$.

Although we are now talking about cm2, the numerical value of $2l + 2w$ is still 62. Adding 4 to this, we can say that the area increases by 66 cm2.

Since the second trip takes a total of 26 minutes less than the first trip, we can write d = 45(t - 26/60) for the second trip. The distance is the same going to work and coming home, so we can equate the two expressions, giving us 30t= 45(t - 26/60). Distributing on the right side, we get $30t = 45t -$ 1170/60. Solving for t, we get 15t = 1170/60 and then t = 78/60. In this form, we can see that it takes 78 minutes for Sam to drive to work at 30 mi/h, but we can also express this time as 13/10 hours.

First, for the value of the units place of the answer, since an even number times 5 produces a zero, which we don't have, and an odd number times 5 produces another 5, which we don't have, the 5 cannot be in the units place of any of the three numbers.

                "Solution": "Let b represent the number of animals in Ben's collection and j represent the number of animals in Jerry's collection. Since Jerry has 10 more animals than Ben, we have that $j = b + 10$. We also know that the total number of legs in both collections combined is 220 legs. So, 2b+ $4j = 220$. We can substitute the quantity $b + 10$ for j in this equation to get 2b + 4(b $+ 10) = 220$. Simplifying and solving for b, the result is $2b + 4b + 40 = 220 \\rightarrow 6b + 40 = 220 \\rightarrow 6b = 180 \\rightarrow b = 30$. Therefore, Jerry's collection contains $30 + 10 = 40$ toy animals.",

We are looking for three digits that have a sum of 9, with no two digits the same and the first digit can't be zero. Let us represent the sum of 9 with diamonds. We need to separate these diamonds into three different sections, so we need two partitions, as shown. No matter how we rearrange these diamonds and partitions, they will always correspond to one set of three numbers with a sum of 9. However, one diamond, indicated by the unfilled diamonds in the figure, must remain in the first partition and cannot be rearranged. It must remain there, so that the first number is at least 1.

                "Solution": "This problem may require some exploration. The prime factorization of 720 (the volume) is 24 $\\times$ 32 $\\times$ 51. This number has $5 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 30$ factors, so there are a lot of possible sets of three integer side lengths for the rectangular prism. Let's suppose the edge lengths are a, b and c. Then, using the surface area formula, we have 666 = 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields the equation 333=ab+ac+bc. Now we have to select the values for our edge lengths a, b and c from the prime factors of 720 so that this equation is true. The fact that 333 is odd is very helpful. This means that one of the products ab, ac or bc is odd (they can't all three be odd), which in turn means that two of the three edge lengths must be odd. This narrows our search considerably. We should try such triplets as 3-5-48, 5-9-16 and 3-15-16. It turns out that 3-15-16 works, since $3 \\times 15 \\times 16 = 720$ and $(3 \\times 15) + (3 \\times 16) + (15 \\times 16) = 45 + 48 + 240 = 333$.

Then no combination to make 5 works. Eventually we see that E= $4, T = 3$ and $S = 7$ works. Now we have the sum as shown. The desired value is A+ $T + E + O = 9 + 3 + 4 + 0 = 16$.",

Therefore, $\\triangle$AFG, $\\triangle$ADE and $\\triangle$ACB are all similar. This means that the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. In particular, AG:GF = AE:ED = AB:BC, so 4/x = AE/2x = AB/3x, and therefore, we know that AE = 8 units and AB=12units. We need to find the value of x. A key step is to notice that quadrilateral DEFG is a kite, so DG = DE = 2x units. Thus, AD $= 4 + 2x$ units. We also have that AD=$\\surd$(82+(2x)2) = $\\surd$(64 + 4x2) units.

Subtracting 4x2 from both sides, we get $16 + 16x = 64$, which means that $16x = 48$ and x =3. Now we can determine that $\\triangle$AFG is a 3-4-5 right triangle and BC = 9. Since we know AB = 12, we can determine that $\\triangle$ACB is a 9-12-15 right triangle. Because CA = 15, EF = 3 and AF = 5, we know CE $= 15 - 3 - 5 = 7$ units.",

                "Solution": "The three index cards in the center of the structure form an equilateral triangle, so the angles must each measure 60\u00b0. Since the structure rests on a flat, level surface, the angles on either side of the 60\u00b0 angle in the middle must add up to 180 - 60 = 120\u00b0. If we let the measure of one of the angles be a and the measure of the other angle be b, then we know that $a + b =$ 120\u00b0. Also, since all the index cards are the same length, the triangles on the left and right must each be isosceles. This means we have another angle of a degrees in the left triangle and another angle of b degrees in the right triangle. The sum of the angles of any triangle is always 180\u00b0, so the sum 2a $+ x + 2b + y = 2 \\times 180$. This can be rewritten as 2(a $+ b) + x + y = 360$.

                "Solution": "Solving this problem requires some tricky algebra. Let the three numbers be a, b and c. From the information given, we have $a + b + c$ =5, $a2 + b2 + c2 = 29$ and abc = -10. If we square each side of the first equation, we get $(a + b +$ c)2 $= 52 \\rightarrow a2 + b2 + c2 +$ 2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 25. Now let's substitute 29 for $a2 + b2 + c2$ in this equation to get 29 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 25. Subtracting 29 from each side and dividing the equation by 2 yields ab + bc + ac = -2. Let's now multiply each side of this equation by c to get abc + bc2 + ac2 = -2c. We can replace abc with -10 to get -10+bc2+ac2= -2c. Now let's factor out c2 on the left side of the equation to get -10 + c2(b + a) = -2c. If $a + b + c = 5$ then $a + b = 5 - c$. Thus, we can replace b+a with 5 - c to get -10 + c2(5 - c) = -2c. Distributing c2 and combining like terms yields -10 = c3 - 5c2 -2c. If we set this cubic equal to 0, the result is c3 - 5c2 -2c $+ 10 = 0$. Factoring this equation yields c2(c - 5) - 2(c $- 5) = 0 \\rightarrow (c2 -$ 2)(c $- 5) = 0$. Now we see that the three solutions are -$\\surd$2, $\\surd$2 and 5, the least of which is -$\\surd$2.",

                "Solution": "This problem may prove easier to solve if we can situate the figure in the coordinate plane. Let's suppose the left, rear corner of the base, which is point E, is situated at the origin with coordinates (0, 0, 0). Since all the edges have length 2 units, the other vertices would be located as follows: F(2, 0, 0), G(2, 0, 2), H(0, 0, 2), A(0, 2, 0), B(2, 2, 0), C(2, 2, 2), D(0, 2, 2), M(0, 0, 1) and N(1, 0, 0). If we let point K be the midpoint of $\\overline{N,}$ the original tetrahedron is divided into two congruent tetrahedrons with common base $\\triangle$ACK. Since $\\overline{MN}$ is the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle with legs of length 1 unit, its length is $\\surd$2 units. Thus, each of these two smaller tetrahedrons has height h = MK = NK = $\\surd$2/2 units. Now to determine the area of $\\triangle$ACK, we first consider rectangle ACGE. Since $\\overline{AC}$ is the diagonal of one of the faces of the cube, it is also the hypotenuse of a 45-45-90 right triangle with legs of length 2 units. That means AC = 2$\\surd$2 units and rectangle ACGE has an area of 4$\\surd$2 units2. Next we determine the area of $\\triangle$AEK to be (1/2) $\\times$ ($\\surd$2/2) $\\times$ 2 = $\\surd$2/2 units2, and the area of $\\triangle$CGK is (1/2)$\\times$ (3$\\surd$2/2) $\\times$ 2 = 3$\\surd$2/2 units2. If we subtract these two areas from the area of rectangle ACGE, the result is the area of $\\triangle$ACK. The area of $\\triangle$ACK is 4$\\surd$2 - ($\\surd$2/2) - (3$\\surd$2/2) = (8$\\surd$2/2) - ($\\surd$2/2) - (3$\\surd$2/2)= (4$\\surd$2/2)= 2$\\surd$2 units2. The volume of each of the smaller tetrahedrons is (1/3) $\\times$ (2$\\surd$2) $\\times$ ($\\surd$2/2) = 2/3units3. Therefore the volume of the large tetrahedron is 2/3 + 2/3 = 4/3 units3.",

                "Solution": "A set of seven positive integers with a mean of 13 must have a sum of $7 \\times 13 = 91$. Since the integers must be positive and different, the smallest possible value of the median is 4. The numbers could be 1, 2, 3, 4 and any combination of three different positive integers adding up to $91 - (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = 81$. To find the largest possible median, we should first allow for $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$ at the low end. That leaves $91 - 6 = 85$ to be distributed to the other four integers. We will need another $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$ to make the 5th, 6th and 7th integers greater than the 4th integer, so that leaves $85 - 6 = 79$ to divide by 4. Algebraically, we can solve $n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) + (n + 3) < 85$ for the greatest integer value of n that satisfies the inequality.

                "Solution": "It is safe to assume that the greatest possible product will be produced by a two-digit number times a three-digit number, so let's call those numbers AB and XYZ. The value of AB is 10A + B and the value of XYZ is $100X + 10Y + Z$. The product (10A + B)(100X $+ 10Y + Z) =$ 1000AX + 100AY + 100BX + 10AZ + 10BY + BZ. First let's compare the way the digits A and X are used. They each get multiplied by 1000 and by each other, which is symmetric. They also each get multiplied by 100 and by another digit, but A is also multiplied by 10Z; therefore we want A to be the largest number of the set, and X should be the next largest. Thus, we determine that $A = 8$ and $X = 7$. We can now write $(1000 \\times 8 \\times 7) + (100 \\times 8 \\times Y) + (100 \\times 7 \\times B) + (10 \\times 8 \\times Z) +$ 10BY + BZ = 56,000 $+ 800Y + 700B + 80Z +$ 10BY + BZ.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by u2, we get $(2 + a) + 5u + (2 -$ a)u2 = 0 . Since our first equation and this last equation are both equal to zero, we can set them equal to each other to get ru2 + su $+ t = (2 + a) + 5u + (2 -$ a)u2. Both of these expressions are in terms of u, so the coefficients of the same degree must be equal. This means that $r = 2 - a$, $s = 5$ and $t = 2 + a$.

Since 6-8-10 is a Pythagorean triple, we know we have a right angle between the legs of lengths 6 units and 8 units. Therefore, the area of the triangle is 1/2 $\\times 6 \\times 8 = 24$ units2. That means that 1/2 $\\times r \\times 10 = 24$ units2 and $5r = 24$, so r=4.8units. This will serve as the radius of the base of each cone. Now we know the volume of the top cone is (1/3) $\\times$ $\\pi$ $\\times$ (4.8)2 $\\times$ h1 and the volume of the bottom cone is (1/3)$\\times$$\\pi$ $\\times$ (4.8)2 $\\times$ h2. Together, these are (1/3) $\\times$ $\\pi$ $\\times$ (4.8)2 $\\times$ h1 + (1/3) $\\times$ $\\pi$ $\\times$ (4.8)2 $\\times$ h2 $\\rightarrow$ (1/3)$\\times$$\\pi$$\\times$(4.8)2$\\times$(h1 + h2). We know that $h1 + h2 = 10$ units, so the volume of the entire solid is (1/3) $\\times$ $\\pi$ $\\times$ (4.8)2 $\\times (10) = 241.3$ units3. Note: Using similar triangles, one could determine the lengths of h1 and h2 and find the volume of each of the two cones.",

Since $\\overline{PQ}$ bisects this area, the area of $\\triangle$QPR must be 2.5 units2. The height of $\\triangle$QPR is 2 units, so we can solve for the length of the base, b, using the equation 2.5 = (1/2) $\\times$ 2 $\\times$ b. So, $b = 2.5$ units. Thus the length of segment QR is 2.5 units. If we drop a perpendicular from point P to pointT on segment QR, as shown, we split segment QR into two right triangles. We know that ST=2units, QR = 2.5 units and RS = 3 units, so QT= (2+2.5)-3 $= 4.5 - 3 = 1.5$ units.

                "Solution": "In a geometric progression, there is a constant ratio between consecutive terms; we will call it r. Let's say the length of the shorter leg of the right triangle is x. Then the longer leg has length rx, and the hypotenuse has length r2x. These three lengths must satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem, so we have x2 + (rx)2 = (r2x)2, or x2 + r2x2 = r4x2. If we factor out x2, we get x2(1 + r2) = r4x2. Since we know that x is a positive length, it is safe to divide both sides of the equation by x2. That leaves $1 + r2 = r4$. Although this is a fourth degree equation, we can solve it like a quadratic if we substitute $s = r2$. This gives us $1 + s = s2$, which we rewrite as $s2 - s - 1 = 0$. This does not factor, so we use the quadratic formula to find that the solutions are $s = (1$ \u00b1 $\\surd$5)/2. Recall that $s = r2$, and since we want the positive value, we have $r2 = (1 +$ $\\surd$5)/2. We need to find the ratio x/r2x, and the x values cancel, so we get the reciprocal of (1 + $\\surd$5)/2, which is 2/(1 + $\\surd$5) $\\approx$ 0.62.",

                "Solution": "Let's say the initial height of each candle is 1 unit. At any time, t (in hours), after they are lit, the heights of the candles are 1 - t/6 and 1-t/9, respectively. At some particular time t, the height of the slower-burning candle is twice that of the faster-burning candle, so we have 1-t/9 = 2(1 - t/6), which can be rewritten as 1 - t/9 = 2 - t/3. Multiplying both sides by 9, we get $9 - t = 18 - 3t$. Solving for t, we get $2t = 9$.

                "Solution": "In an arithmetic sequence, successive terms are determined by adding a common difference to the previous term. When we get to the 18th term, a18, we would have added the common difference to the first term 17 times. In other words, if d is the common difference between terms of the sequence, then $a18 = a1 + 17d$. We can substitute the given values for the first and 18th terms to get the following equation: $8.25 = 4 + 17d$. Subtracting 4 from each side, we get $4.25 = 17d$, and then dividing each side by 17 yields $d = 0.25$. Now for the 35th term we have $a35 = a1 + 34d$. Substituting 4 for a1 and 0.25 for d, we see that $a35 = 4 + (34 \\times 0.25) = 4 + 8.5 = 12.5$. Also notice that the difference between the 18th and 1st terms, which is 17d, must be the same as the difference between the 35th and 18th terms, also 17d. Since $17d = 4.25$, we know the 35th term is 8.25+4.25 = 12.5.",
