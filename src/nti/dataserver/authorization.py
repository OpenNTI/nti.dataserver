Constants and classes relating to authorisation (principals, groups,
and group memberships).

Comparison to libACL
====================

The previous system, libACL, made a distinction between three axis of
security:

*Authentication*
	Are you who you say you are?

*Authorization*
	Can you take the action you are proposing?

*Access Control*
	If you are who you say you are, and you can generally perform the
	action, can you perform it to this specific bit of data?

Authorization was provided by a system of *capabilities* would could
be assigned to individual users, groups, or roles. A user could belong
to any number of groups and roles. These capabilities were effectively
global in nature and were open-ended.

Access control was specific to individual bits of data and was
implemented by providing each object with an ACL, which listed groups
or principals and their assigned access rights. These rights were
fixed to a small set.

In practice, ACLs and capabilities were rarely combined. Either a
capability was required, or an object was protected with an ACL.

Noting that fact we simplify things here by combining authorization
with access control and calling the result simply authorization.

.. note::
   Higher levels may group together collections of permissions or access to
   defined features and call those "capabilities."

General Principles
==================

To determine the access to some object/action pair, we follow the
*access path* to the object, from the object working towards the root
of the path. (Thus, more specific entries will override less specific
entries.) The root object should contain entries for things that apply
generally (equivalent to global capabilities.).

Persistent storage references to principals should be by their unique
identifier string (not object identity). Yet ACLs should hold
``IPrincipal`` objects. This conversion happens through (optionally named)
ZCA adapters. Likewise, the permissions in an ACL entry should be
``IPermission`` objects, but persistent storage should be strings;
conversion is handled by registering ``IPermission`` objects by name as
utilities.

Namespaces
==========

Principals, groups, and roles all share a flat namespace. Principals
(and groups and communities) do not have a prefix. Roles have a prefix ending in ``role:``;
sub-types of roles may have a prefix to that, such as ``content-role:``.

			#   through the 'flattenedSharingTargetNames' before
			#   coming up with principals, which wind up being
			#   _StringPrincipal objects below. It's not exactly clear
			#   why they do that.
			# * Meantime, authentication winds up returning actual
			# * objects like _CommunityGroup.
			# * Typical _UserPrincipal objects, like _CommunityGroup,
			#   capture 'username' as their ID.
			# * However, certain types of dynamic memberships
			#   (increasingly, all of them!) do not have a globally
			#   useful username. Thus, everything is moving to
