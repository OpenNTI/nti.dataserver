	A weak ref that also stores a one-shot copy of its

	Use this if the object is expected to mutate after this reference
	is established and you normally want to have access to those changes,
	and you cannot tolerate the object going missing, but you also
	cannot keep a strong reference to the object. This may be particularly
	the case in cross-database refs.
