so I would say this chapter is probably as close to an ethnographic study of communication as Iíll likely ever get

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.820
It seems that almost every month thereís a new article online discussing common errors in emails and cover letters that cost potential employees a job opportunity.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.830
so thatís something to consider in both work and life contexts.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.960
Itís also a good idea to censure your emails carefully.
