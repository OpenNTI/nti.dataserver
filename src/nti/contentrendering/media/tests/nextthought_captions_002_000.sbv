The idea here is really to understand what
are those common fundamental drivers that

0:00:13.870,0:00:20.870
we see in financial crises and banking crises.
How can we diagnose them and forecast them.

0:00:21.470,0:00:22.449
Okay.

0:00:22.449,0:00:29.449
So that's our agenda. And again after each
of these major topics, we'll have some exercises

0:00:32.680,0:00:34.240
to review the learning.

0:00:34.240,0:00:39.450
So systemic risk drivers: we're seeing very,
very common drivers across all the major,

0:00:39.450,0:00:46.450
you know, financial crises. And there are
ways of predicting and diagnosing them that

0:00:48.310,0:00:55.310
are very useful to apply. And we'll talk about
the difference between Black Swan events and

0:00:55.370,0:01:02.370
what Didier Sornette, who's a geologist calls
a Dragon King. So that's an interesting discussion

0:01:02.790,0:01:09.790
about exogenous versus endogenous risks. Outliers
as early warning signals are very, very important.

0:01:10.580,0:01:17.580
That universal signal that something, either
it's spurious data or something really important

0:01:17.869,0:01:22.819
has happened. The distribution has shifted,
and we'll show you how to interpret some of

0:01:22.819,0:01:25.109
those signals. Okay.

0:01:25.109,0:01:32.109
So let's dive into Systemic Risk Drivers.
Banking crises follow very similar trajectories.

0:01:32.780,0:01:39.780
They are generally driven by first surges
in international capital flow and an increase

0:01:42.340,0:01:49.340
in asset prices, fueled by liquidity or credit.
This is a study by Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart,

0:01:51.740,0:01:58.740
"Banking Crises: An Equal Opportunity Menace."
And it shows that the proportion of economies

0:02:01.069,0:02:07.389
going through a banking crisis, and you can
see that, you know, and quite often we can

0:02:07.389,0:02:14.389
get to, you know, anywhere from fifteen percent
or more of the world economy on a weighted

0:02:14.480,0:02:18.989
basis is in some kind of a banking crisis.
So banking crises are actually fairly, fairly

0:02:18.989,0:02:23.939
common. There was a big stretch after the
war when we didn't have any, right, which

0:02:23.939,0:02:29.989
gave us sort of the illusion that maybe, you
know, banking crises had been solved. But

0:02:29.989,0:02:35.799
obviously, they've come back with a vengeance.
So you can see these big spikes here. That's

0:02:35.799,0:02:41.750
over close to forty percent of the world economy
being in a banking crisis. We're seeing similar

0:02:41.750,0:02:48.750
drivers in Emerging Markets and Developed
Markets, and financial centers are especially

0:02:49.890,0:02:50.420
vulnerable.

0:02:50.420,0:02:51.500
[Slide change]

0:02:51.500,0:02:56.720
Another interesting correlation is that financial
liberalization and capital mobility tend to

0:02:56.720,0:02:59.290
have a destabilizing effect. Right.

0:02:59.290,0:03:06.290
So this is a chart here that Rogoff quotes,
which essentially shows where they're plotting,

0:03:07.360,0:03:14.360
they're ranking financial liberalization on
the red chart and actually banking crises,

0:03:15.459,0:03:20.390
okay. Sum of the countries in banking crises,
and you can see there's a relationship. When

0:03:20.390,0:03:27.159
there is a, you know, when liberalization
is going up, banking crises tend to spike

0:03:27.159,0:03:34.159
thereafter and quite often this is the case
of a process of deregulation while as well

0:03:36.709,0:03:43.709
of having more lax supervision. So this is
again one of the themes that we clearly saw

0:03:44.230,0:03:46.810
in the more recent crisis.

0:03:46.810,0:03:48.930
[Slide Change]

0:03:48.930,0:03:54.840
In terms of foreign capital inflows, it's
interesting to look at say the U.S. internet

0:03:54.840,0:04:01.629
bubble here. Foreign capital into equities
had peaked with the internet bubble. Foreign

0:04:01.629,0:04:08.629
capital into the fixed income markets peaked
with the credit bubble. So that surge in international

0:04:09.370,0:04:16.370
capital was certainly a function of the sub-prime
crisis in the United States.

0:04:17.829,0:04:24.210
We're having an obvious debt problem around
the world. Increased levels of debt to G.D.P.

0:04:24.210,0:04:31.210
The United States exceeded 300% total debt
to G.D.P. in 2003, and it's been going up

0:04:34.479,0:04:40.120
in the entire developed world. And so that's
an unprecedented level of debt that we need

0:04:40.120,0:04:42.220
to understand how to resolve.

0:04:42.220,0:04:43.190
[Slide Change]

0:04:43.190,0:04:48.250
And there are three ways to really resolve
a debt crisis. The first is through economic

0:04:48.250,0:04:55.250
growth. And you know hopefully there will
be strong economic growth, but there are you

0:04:57.259,0:05:04.190
know, but historical studies really show that
you know strong economic growth following

0:05:04.190,0:05:10.460
these kind of crises tend to be quite rare.
In a big McKinsey study I think, from analyzing

0:05:10.460,0:05:17.460
something like 38 crises, they found that
in only three cases have, you know, economies

0:05:17.560,0:05:23.270
bounced back very strongly after a banking
crisis. And in each case that was quite unique.

0:05:23.270,0:05:30.009
In Nigeria and Egypt that was due to discovering
a lot of oil, oil wealth. And in the United

0:05:30.009,0:05:34.770
States the postwar effect was essentially,
well that the U.S., you know it was the war

0:05:34.770,0:05:39.150
dividend or the peace dividend. The U.S. was
the only industrialized economy left with

0:05:39.150,0:05:46.150
manufacturing capabilities. So a much more
common path is going to be a decade or so

0:05:47.889,0:05:54.550
of sub par economic and credit growth and
of course it will be a long stretch for the

0:05:54.550,0:06:01.550
United States, which really since the Internet
Bubble popped in 2000, you know really hasn't

0:06:02.080,0:06:09.080
showed signs of sustainable strong growth.
Right. So if we look at the blue bars are

0:06:11.410,0:06:17.680
G.D.P as reported, but the red bars are adjusted
by mortgage equity withdrawals, essentially

0:06:17.680,0:06:24.680
what people took out, using using their housing
as banks, which really went into fueling discretionary

0:06:27.310,0:06:31.590
spending. If you took out mortgage equity
withdrawals, you'll see that essentially from

0:06:31.590,0:06:38.550
the dot com bust to the housing crisis, there
has been no economic growth, so essentially

0:06:38.550,0:06:43.330
the United States has flatlined in terms of
economic growth for a decade, for well over

0:06:43.330,0:06:50.330
a decade already. It's been essentially twelve
years, you know, of very, very low growth.

0:06:52.169,0:06:57.340
So you know someone who I was having a conversation
with someone said that yeah, I think we're

0:06:57.340,0:07:03.500
going to face something similar as Japan.
You know. Decades of slow kind of growth.

0:07:03.500,0:07:09.509
Well, in a way the U.S. has already been through
a decade of that.

0:07:09.509,0:07:16.509
The second more severe path is inflation,
which is quite common as well.

0:07:19.319,0:07:25.599
And the most extreme would be a current devaluation
followed by a credit default.

0:07:25.599,0:07:31.270
So those are sort of three archetypal paths,
that we need to be able to look at in terms

0:07:31.270,0:07:38.270
of creating the scenarios that we are going
to look at for stress testing. A quote from

0:07:38.720,0:07:43.830
Ken Rogoff saying that by guaranteeing everything
governments have transformed the financial

0:07:43.830,0:07:50.830
crisis into a debt crisis. Who guarantees
the government? That's what he said in 2009,

0:07:50.830,0:07:53.360
and obviously we're now dealing with a Sovereign
Crisis.
