This does not end the inquiry, of course, for the First and Fourteenth Amendments have never been thought to give absolute protection to every individual to speak whenever or wherever he pleases, or to use any form of address in any circumstances that he chooses.

The ability of government, consonant with the Constitution, to shut off discourse solely to protect others from hearing it is, in other words, dependent upon a showing that substantial privacy interests are being invaded in an essentially intolerable manner.

Those in the Los Angeles courthouse could effectively avoid further bombardment of their sensibilities simply by averting their eyes. And, while it may be that one has a more substantial claim to a recognizable privacy interest when walking through a courthouse corridor than, for example, strolling through Central Park, surely it is nothing like the interest in <a name="22"></a> <span class="nti.pagenum" id="a0000000010" style="font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold">22</span> being free from unwanted expression in the confines of one&#8217;s own home.

It is whether California can excise, as "offensive conduct," one particular scurrilous epithet from the public discourse, either upon the theory of the court below that its use is inherently likely to cause violent reaction or upon a more general assertion that the States, acting as guardians of public morality, <a name="23"></a> <span class="nti.pagenum" id="a0000000012" style="font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold">23</span> may properly remove this offensive word from the public vocabulary. </p><a name="0caf19152a917f91697719095a47214b"></a> <p class="par" id="0caf19152a917f91697719095a47214b">The rationale of the California court is plainly untenable.

We have been shown no evidence that substantial numbers of citizens are standing ready to strike out physically at whoever may assault their sensibilities with execrations like that uttered by Cohen. There may be some persons about with such lawless and violent proclivities, but that is an insufficient base upon which to erect, consistently with constitutional values, a governmental power to force persons who wish to ventilate their dissident views into avoiding particular forms of expression. The argument amounts to little more than the self-defeating proposition that to avoid physical censorship of one who has not sought to provoke such a response by a hypothetical coterie of the violent and lawless, the States may more appropriately effectuate that censorship themselves.

Equally important to our conclusion is the constitutional backdrop against which our decision must be made. The constitutional right of free expression is powerful medicine in a society as diverse and populous as ours. It is designed and intended to remove governmental restraints from the arena of public discussion, putting the decision as to what views shall be voiced largely into the hands of each of us, in the hope that use of such freedom will ultimately produce a more capable citizenry and more perfect polity and in the belief that no other approach would comport with the premise of individual dignity and choice upon which our political system rests.

These are, however, within established limits, in truth necessary side effects of the broader enduring values which the process of open debate permits us to achieve. That the air may at times seem filled with verbal cacophony is, in this sense not a sign of weakness but of strength. We cannot lose sight of the fact that, in what otherwise might seem a trifling and annoying instance of individual distasteful abuse of a privilege, these fundamental societal values are truly implicated. That is why "[w]holly neutral futilities &#8230;come under the protection of free speech as fully as do Keats&#8217; poems or Donne&#8217;s sermons," <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16314089118204976902&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,37"> <i class="itshape">Winters</i> v. <i class="itshape">New York,</i> 333 U.

First, the principle contended for by the State seems inherently boundless. How is one to distinguish this from any other offensive word? Surely the State has no right to cleanse public debate to the point where it is grammatically palatable to the most squeamish among us. Yet no readily ascertainable general principle exists for stopping short of that result were we to affirm the judgment below. For, while the particular four-letter word being litigated here is perhaps more distasteful than most others of its genre, it is nevertheless often true that one man&#8217;s vulgarity is another&#8217;s lyric. Indeed, we think it is largely because governmental officials cannot make principled distinctions in this area that the Constitution leaves matters of taste and style so largely to the individual. </p><a name="f6a0447e1a81e8f8a8c790f44d7152d3"></a> <p class="par" id="f6a0447e1a81e8f8a8c790f44d7152d3">Additionally, we cannot overlook the fact, because it <a name="26"></a> <span class="nti.pagenum" id="a0000000016" style="font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold">26</span> is well illustrated by the episode involved here, that much linguistic expression serves a dual communicative function: it conveys not only ideas capable of relatively precise, detached explication, but otherwise inexpressible emotions as well. In fact, words are often chosen as much for their emotive as their cognitive force. We cannot sanction the view that the Constitution, while solicitous of the cognitive content of individual speech, has little or no regard for that emotive function which, practically speaking, may often be the more important element of the overall message sought to be communicated. Indeed, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter has said, "[o]ne of the prerogatives of American citizenship is the right to criticize public men and measures&#8212;and that means not only informed and responsible criticism but the freedom to speak foolishly and without moderation." <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5171704793084931432&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,37"> <i class="itshape">Baumgartner</i> v. <i class="itshape">United States,</i> 322 U.

Indeed, governments might soon seize upon the censorship of particular words as a convenient guise for banning the expression of unpopular views. We have been able, as noted above, to discern little social benefit that might result from running the risk of opening the door to such grave results. </p><a name="f5344e3e6fef11c346c3d4082ad24ffc"></a> <p class="par" id="f5344e3e6fef11c346c3d4082ad24ffc">It is, in sum, our judgment that, absent a more particularized and compelling reason for its actions, the State may not, consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, make the simple public display here involved of this single four-letter expletive a criminal offense.

For example, the statute also prohibits disturbing "the peace or quiet &#8230;by loud or unusual noise" and using "vulgar, profane, or indecent language within the presence or hearing of women or children, in a loud and boisterous manner." See n. 1, <i class="itshape">supra.</i> This second-quoted provision in particular serves to put the actor on much fairer notice as to what is prohibited. It also buttresses our view that the "offensive conduct" portion, as construed and applied in this case, cannot legitimately be justified in this Court as designed or intended to make fine distinctions between differently situated recipients.</span> <a href="#ma0000000011">&#8617;</a> </li> <li id="a0000000013"> <span>The <i class="itshape">amicus</i> urges, with some force, that this issue is not properly before us since the statute, as construed, punishes only conduct that might cause others to react violently. However, because the opinion below appears to erect a virtually irrebuttable presumption that use of this word will produce such results, the statute as thus construed appears to impose, in effect, a flat ban on the public utterance of this word. With the case in this posture, it does not seem inappropriate to inquire whether any other rationale might properly support this result. While we think it clear, for the reasons expressed above, that no statute which merely proscribes "offensive conduct" and has been construed as broadly as this one was below can subsequently be justified in this Court as discriminating between conduct that occurs in different places or that offends only certain persons, it is not so unreasonable to seek to justify its full broad sweep on an alternate rationale such as this. Because it is not so patently clear that acceptance of the justification presently under consideration would render the statute overbroad or unconstitutionally vague, and because the answer to appellee&#8217;s argument seems quite clear, we do not pass on the contention that this claim is not presented on this record.</span> <a href="#ma0000000013">&#8617;</a> </li> </ol> </div> </body></html>
