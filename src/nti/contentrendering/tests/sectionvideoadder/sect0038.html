<a name="a0000006799"></a>
<p> <a name="a0000006800" id="a0000006800"></a> <a name="a0000006801" id="a0000006801"></a> </p><a name="a0000006802"></a>
<p>When we <span class="def">round</span> an integer to a particular power of 10, we mean that we approximate our number by the closest number that’s a multiple of our chosen power of 10. For example, the number <span></span>
 is nearer to <span></span>
 than to <span></span>
, so <span></span>
 rounds to the nearest thousand as <span></span>
. Similarly, <span></span>
 rounds to the nearest hundred as <span></span>
, because <span></span>
 is closer to <span></span>
 than to <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000006803"></a>
<p>We always round to the nearest whole multiple of the power of 10 that we’re rounding to. If a number is exactly halfway between two whole multiples of the power of 10 that we’re rounding to, then we always pick the larger one. For example, the number <span></span>
 gets rounded to the nearest thousand as <span></span>
, even though <span></span>
 is equally close to <span></span>
 and <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000006804"></a>
<p>We can also round decimals. The simplest sort of rounding for a decimal is to round it to the nearest integer. Remember that 1 is a power of 10, since <span></span>
, so rounding to an integer is essentially “rounding to a multiple of 1.” For example, <span class="mathnumber">2.18</span> rounds to the nearest integer as <span class="mathnumber">2</span>, and <span class="mathnumber">5.891</span> rounds to the nearest integer as <span class="mathnumber">6</span>. </p><a name="a0000006805"></a>
<p>We can also round a decimal to the nearest tenth, nearest hundredth, or to any decimal place that we choose. For instance, <span class="mathnumber">3.419</span> rounds to the nearest tenth to <span class="mathnumber">3.4</span> or to the nearest hundredth as <span class="mathnumber">3.42</span>. We also sometimes say that <span class="mathnumber">3.419</span> rounds to <span class="mathnumber">3.4</span> “to one decimal place” or rounds to <span class="mathnumber">3.42</span> “to two decimal places.” Again, if a number is exactly halfway between the two nearest multiples of the power of 10 that we’re rounding to, we always pick the larger one. For example, <span class="mathnumber">11.35</span> rounded to the nearest tenth is <span class="mathnumber">11.4</span>, even though <span class="mathnumber">11.35</span> is exactly halfway between <span class="mathnumber">11.3</span> and <span class="mathnumber">11.4</span>. </p><a name="a0000006806"></a>
<p>We often round numbers in our everyday life because it’s usually easier for us to think about “round” numbers rather than exact numbers. For example, the high temperature today might be <span class="mathnumber">78.39</span> degrees, but the weather forecast will probably just say “high of 78” and your mom might tell you that it’s “about 80 degrees.” Another common use of rounding is with large numbers that are hard to measure exactly. For example, according to the 2010 census, the population of Los Angeles is <span></span>
 people, but it is silly to think that this number can be exactly measured. It is more meaningful, and easier to process, if we round and say that the population of Los Angeles is about 3.8 million people. </p><a name="a0000006807"></a>
<p>We also use rounding to simplify or check calculations. For instance, if you wanted to multiply <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, we could instead multiply the numbers rounded to the nearest thousand, <span></span>
 and <span></span>
. This multiplication is just </p>

<p><span class="mathnumber">1.651</span> is slightly closer to <span class="mathnumber">1.7</span> than to <span class="mathnumber">1.6</span>. We can tell because <span class="mathnumber">1.65</span> is exactly halfway between them, and <span class="mathnumber">1.651</span> is a little bit larger than <span class="mathnumber">1.65</span>. So <span class="mathnumber">1.65</span> rounded to the nearest tenth is <span class="mathnumber">1.7</span>. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006847"></a>

Many people would write the answer as <span class="mathnumber">0.0</span> to emphasize that it is rounded to the tenths decimal place, but of course <span class="mathnumber">0</span> and <span class="mathnumber">0.0</span> are the same number. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006849"></a>
<p><span class="mathnumber">0.1972</span> is closer to <span class="mathnumber">0.20</span> than to <span class="mathnumber">0.19</span>, so <span class="mathnumber">0.1972</span> rounded to the nearest hundredth is <span class="mathnumber">0.2</span>.

<p><span class="mathnumber">-2.35</span> is exactly halfway between <span class="mathnumber">-2.3</span> and <span class="mathnumber">-2.4</span>, so by rule, it rounds to the greater number, or <span class="mathnumber">-2.3</span>. Note that <span class="mathnumber">2.35</span>, by the same rule, would round to <span class="mathnumber">2.4</span>, so here is an example of a number <span class="mathname">x</span> for which <span class="mathname">x</span> and <span></span>

<p>Each of these numbers is between <span class="mathnumber">4.7</span> and <span class="mathnumber">4.8</span>, and is closer to <span class="mathnumber">4.7</span> than to <span class="mathnumber">4.8</span> because each is less than <span class="mathnumber">4.75</span>. Therefore, each rounded to the nearest tenth is 4.7. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006860"></a>
<p>Part (a) suggests that only the hundredths digit matters when rounding to the nearest tenth, because even adding a digit of 9 to go from <span class="mathnumber">4.73</span> to <span class="mathnumber">4.739</span> doesn’t change the fact that we round down. Indeed, any number of the form <span></span>
, where <span class="mathname">D</span> is one of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, will satisfy </p>
<div id="a0000006862" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006863"></a>
<p> (Here we write <span></span>
 not to mean <span class="mathnumber">4.7</span> multiplied by <span class="mathname">D</span>, but instead to mean the number with 4 as the units digit, 7 as the tenths digit, and <span class="mathname">D</span> as the hundredths digit.) Moreover, adding additional digits after the <span class="mathname">D</span> will still keep the number below <span class="mathnumber">4.75</span>. So any number of the form <span></span>
, where <span class="mathname">D</span> is one of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, is rounded down to the nearest tenth to <span class="mathnumber">4.7</span>. (Actually, there is one technical exception to this rule, which we will discuss in Section <a href="sec-repeatingdecimals.html">6.4</a>.) </p><a name="a0000006864"></a>
<p>On the other hand, if <span class="mathname">D</span> is one of the digits 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, then the number <span></span>
 satisfies </p>
<div id="a0000006866" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006867"></a>
<p> and adding additional digits after the <span class="mathname">D</span> will still keep the number between <span class="mathnumber">4.75</span> and <span class="mathnumber">4.8</span>. So <span></span>
, where <span class="mathname">D</span> is one of the digits 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, is rounded up to the nearest tenth to <span class="mathnumber">4.8</span>. This also suggests why we round <span class="mathnumber">4.75</span> up to <span class="mathnumber">4.8</span>, even though it is exactly halfway between <span class="mathnumber">4.7</span> and <span class="mathnumber">4.8</span>: it makes “look at the hundredths digit” a consistent rule for rounding positive numbers to the nearest tenth. </p></li>

<p>Suppose you are told that the number <span class="mathname">x</span> rounds to <span class="mathnumber">2.7</span> when rounded to the nearest tenth. What can you conclude about <span class="mathname">x</span>? </p></div>
<div id="a0000006871" class="solution">Solution for Problem 8:</div>
<span><a name="a0000006872"></a>
<p> We know that <span class="mathname">x</span> rounds to <span class="mathnumber">2.7</span> if <span class="mathname">x</span> is closer to <span class="mathnumber">2.7</span> than to any other multiple of <span class="mathnumber">0.1</span>.

<p> The following argument is not quite good enough: <div class="bogus"> <span></span>
 rounded to the nearest thousand is <span></span>
, and <span></span>
 rounded to the nearest thousand is <span></span>
. Since 1 thousand times 1 thousand is 1 million, the product of the two given numbers rounds, to the nearest million, as <div id="a0000006882" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div> But my friend’s answer rounded to the nearest million is <span></span>
, so it cannot be correct. </div> This is the right idea, but not quite precise enough. It is not necessarily true that the product <span class="mathname">xy</span> rounds in the same way that the product of <span class="mathname">x</span> rounded and <span class="mathname">y</span> rounded do. For example, <span class="mathnumber">6</span> and <span class="mathnumber">7</span> each round to the nearest ten as <span class="mathnumber">10</span>, but their product <span></span>
 does not round to the nearest hundred as <span></span>
, since <span class="mathnumber">42</span> rounded to the nearest hundred is 0. </p><a name="a0000006883"></a>
<p>But we can still use thousands to make an estimate of the product. We note that </p>

<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006886"></a>
