<p> <div class="defn"> A <span class="def">prime number</span> is a positive integer that is divisible by exactly 2 positive integers: 1 and the number itself.

<p><div class="defn"> Let <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span> be integers.

In other words, <span class="mathname">a</span> is a multiple of <span class="mathname">b</span> if there is an integer <span class="mathname">n</span> such that <span></span>
. If <span class="mathname">a</span> is a multiple of <span class="mathname">b</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span> is nonzero, then we say that <span class="mathname">b</span> is a <span class="def">divisor</span>, or <span class="def">factor</span>, of <span class="mathname">a</span>, and that <span class="mathname">a</span> is <span class="def">divisible</span> by <span class="mathname">b</span>. </div> </p><a name="a0000003808"></a>

<p>If a number is a multiple of both <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span>, then we say that the number is a <span class="def">common multiple</span> of <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span>. The smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span> is called the <span class="def">least common multiple</span> of <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span>. We refer to the least common multiple of <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span> as <span></span>

<p><div class="important"> To find the prime factorization of the least common multiple of a group of numbers, we first find the prime factorization of each of the numbers.

<p>If a number is a divisor of both <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span>, then we say that the number is a <span class="def">common divisor</span> of <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span>.

We refer to the greatest common divisor of <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span> as <span></span>

. We say that two integers are <span class="def">relatively prime</span> if their greatest common divisor is 1. </p><a name="a0000003816"></a>
<p><div class="important"><a name="a0000003817"></a>
<p> We can find the greatest common divisor of a group of numbers with the following process: </p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li value="1"><a name="a0000003819"></a>
<p>Find the prime factorization of each number. </p></li><li value="2"><a name="a0000003820"></a>
<p>Identify the primes that appear in <em>all</em> of the prime factorizations. If no primes appear in all of the prime factorizations, then the greatest common divisor of the numbers is 1. </p></li><li value="3"><a name="a0000003821"></a>
<p>Among the prime factorizations, find the smallest power of each prime from Step 2. </p></li><li value="4"><a name="a0000003822"></a>
<p>Multiply the powers of primes found in Step 3. </p></li>
</ol></div> </p><a name="a0000003823"></a>
