<p>In the previous section, we only worked with square roots of perfect squares. In this section, we investigate square roots of integers that are not perfect squares. </p><a name="a0000009204"></a>
<p>We’ll start with <span></span>
. Does <span></span>
 even exist? Is there a number whose square is 2? We know that there isn’t an integer that equals <span></span>
, since there is no integer whose square is 2. Is there a quotient of two integers (a fraction) whose square is 2? The ancient Greeks believed so for quite some time, and legend has it that the man who finally proved that no such quotient exists was drowned at sea for upsetting this belief. (You will have a chance to prove for yourself that no such quotient exists as a Challenge Problem. Don’t worry, no one will drown you at sea if you succeed!) </p><a name="a0000009205"></a>
<p>So, there isn’t an integer whose square is 2, and there isn’t a fraction whose square is 2. But the number <span></span>
 does exist! It’s a new kind of number that we call an <a name="a0000009206" id="a0000009206"></a><span class="def">irrational number</span>. </p><a name="a0000009207"></a>
<p><div class="defn"> An <span class="def">irrational number</span> is a number that cannot be expressed as the quotient of two integers. </div> </p><a name="a0000009208"></a>
<p>We can’t express <span></span>
 as an integer or a fraction, so we can’t express it exactly as a decimal, either. However, we can <em>approximate</em> it using one important rule: </p><a name="a0000009209"></a>
<p><div class="important"> If <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span> are nonnegative numbers such that <span></span>
, then we have <span></span>
. In other words, when comparing the square roots of two nonnegative numbers, the larger number has the larger square root. Similarly, if <span></span>
, then <span></span>
. </div> </p><a name="a0000009210"></a>
<p>Since <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, we expect that the number whose square is 2 must be between 1 and 2. Our rule above tells us that this intuition is correct. In this section, we’ll learn how to use this rule repeatedly to approximate <span></span>
 to as many decimal places as we like, but we will never be able to write a decimal expression that exactly equals <span></span>
. Moreover, a decimal approximation of <span></span>
 does not ever regularly repeat the way the repeating decimals we studied in Section <a href="sec-repeatingdecimals.html">6.4</a> do. </p><div id="a0000009211" class="section-problems"><span class="headingtext">Section Problems</span></div>

<p>By definition, <span></span>
 is the number whose square is 5. So, while we can’t write a decimal or fraction that exactly equals <span></span>
, we do know that the square of <span></span>
 is simply 5. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000009231"></a>
<p>We know how to square <span></span>
, but here we want the sixth power. Once again, our exponent laws help us. Taking the sixth power of a number is the same as first squaring the number and then cubing the result: </p>

<span>
<ol class="parts itemize">
	<li class="part"><a name="a0000009242"></a>
<p>Since <span></span>
, any number that is at least 1.5 has a square that is at least 2.25. This means that no number that is at least 1.5 can be the square root of 2. So, the square root of 2 must be less than 1.5. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000009243"></a>
<p>So far, we know that <span></span>
 is between 1 and 1.5. Since <span></span>
 is closer to 2 than <span></span>
 is, we think that <span></span>
 is probably closer to 1.5 than to 1. Therefore, we try squaring 1.4 next. We have <span></span>
, so we need to square a slightly larger number than <span class="mathnumber">1.4</span> to get 2. We find that <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, so <span></span>
 is between <span class="mathnumber">1.41</span> and <span class="mathnumber">1.42</span>. Therefore, <span></span>
 rounded to the nearest tenth is 1.4. </p></li>
</ol></span><a name="a0000009244"></a>
<p>In a similar method as we used to estimate <span></span>
, we can estimate the square root of any non-square number. We square numbers that we think are close to the desired square root. We then compare the resulting squares to the number whose square root we are trying to find. For example, in Problem <a href="sec-nonsquare.html#prob:rt2approx">2</a>, we found <span></span>
 and <span></span>
. Since <span class="mathnumber">2</span> is between 1.96 and 2.25, we know that <span></span>
 is between 1.4 and 1.5. </p>

<p>Which integers have a square root that is greater than 7 and less than 8? </p></div>
<div id="a0000009248" class="solution">Solution for Problem 10:</div>
<span><a name="a0000009249"></a>
<p> Since 7 is the square root of 49 and 8 is the square root of 64, the square root of any integer between 49 and 64 is between 7 and 8. We can visualize this on the number line: </p>
<div class="align-center"><img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/roots_1.pdf}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000009251"></a>
<p>So, the following integers have square roots greater than 7 and less than 8: </p>
<div id="a0000009253" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div></span><a name="a0000009254"></a>
<p>Just as we can find square roots that fall between integers, we can find integers that fall between square roots. </p>
<div probnum="11" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000009256"></a>
<p>How many integers are between <span></span>
 and <span></span>
? </p></div>
<div id="a0000009258" class="solution">Solution for Problem 11:</div>
<span><a name="a0000009259"></a>
<p> First, we figure out which two consecutive integers <span></span>
 is between. To do so, we find the two consecutive perfect squares that 13 falls between. Since 13 is between 9 and 16, we know that <span></span>
 is between 3 and 4. Similarly, since 131 is between 121 (which is <span></span>
) and 144 (which is <span></span>
), we know that <span></span>
 is between 11 and 12. Again, we can visualize these relationships with a number line: </p>
<div class="align-center"><img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/roots_2.pdf}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000009261"></a>
<p>So, the integers between <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 are the integers from 4 up to 11. There are 8 such integers. </p></span>
<div probnum="12" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000009263"></a>
<p>Find the largest integer less than <span></span>

<div id="a0000009265" class="solution">Solution for Problem 12:</div>
<span><a name="a0000009266"></a>
<p> We start by trying to find an integer near <span></span>
. Since <span></span>
, we start by considering <span></span>
. We’re in luck, since this is an integer: </p>
<div id="a0000009268" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000009269"></a>
<p> So, <span></span>
 is less than 9000. The next perfect square smaller than <span></span>
 is <span></span>
. Rather than computing <span></span>
 to compare it to <span></span>
, we remember what we learned about consecutive squares on page <a href="sect0007.html#consecutiveintegersquare">Squares</a>. Since <span></span>
, we have </p>
<div id="a0000009271" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000009272"></a>
<p> which is definitely less than <span></span>
. So, the largest integer less than <span></span>
 is 8999. </p></span>
<div probnum="13" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000009274"></a>
<p>Which is larger, <span></span>
 or <span></span>
? </p></div>
<div id="a0000009276" class="solution">Solution for Problem 13:</div>
<span><a name="a0000009277"></a>
<p> We typically write the product of a number and a square root without using a multiplication symbol. So, we write <span></span>
 to refer to the product of 2 and <span></span>
, and in this problem we are asked to compare <span></span>
 and <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000009278"></a>
<p>We know how to compare two square roots. The order of two square roots is the same as the order of the squares of the two square roots. For example, we know <span></span>
 because <span></span>
. Similarly, the order of any two nonnegative numbers is the same as the order of their squares. Maybe comparing squares will work on this problem, too. </p><a name="a0000009279"></a>

</div><a name="a0000009283"></a>
<p> These two results are easy to compare. Since <span></span>
 has a larger square than <span></span>
 (and both numbers are nonnegative), we know that <span></span>
 is larger than <span></span>
