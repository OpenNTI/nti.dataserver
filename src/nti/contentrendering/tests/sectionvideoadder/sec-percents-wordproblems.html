<p>Stephanie bought a new computer that cost <span></span>
. Where Stephanie lives, the sales tax rate is <span></span>
. How much sales tax does Stephanie have to pay for her computer? </p></div>
<div id="a0000008582" class="solution">Solution for Problem 8:</div>
<span><a name="a0000008583"></a>
<p> This is a very common “real world” use of percents. Most U.S. states have <a name="a0000008584" id="a0000008584"></a><span class="def">sales tax</span> that gets added to many purchases, and these sales taxes are almost always expressed as a percent of the purchase price. The seller (such as a store or restaurant) simply multiplies the sales tax rate by the purchase price to determine the amount of tax due. As an equation: </p>
<div id="a0000008586" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008587"></a>
<p>In our problem, the item being purchased—a computer—has a price of <span></span>
, and the sales tax rate is <span></span>
. So we compute: </p>
<div id="a0000008589" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008590"></a>
<p> Thus, Stephanie must pay <span></span>
 in sales tax.</p></span><a name="a0000008591"></a>
<p><div class="sidebar"><a name="a0000008592"></a>
<p> Another common percent that is used in restaurants is for tipping. In North America, it is typical to tip <span></span>
 of the total bill to one’s waiter or waitress. For example, if two people spend a total of <span></span>
 on their meal, they would pay an additional <span></span>
 as a tip to their server. In fancier restaurants, the tip rate might be <span></span>
 or even <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000008593"></a>
<a name="a0000008594"></a>
<p>Since <span></span>
 or <span></span>
 is a common sales tax rate in the U.S., an easy way to compute approximately how much to tip is to double the sales tax. Think about why this works! </p></div> </p>
<div probnum="9" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000008596"></a>
<p>Rajiv has 4 blue shirts, 5 black shirts, and 6 white shirts. What percent of his shirts are white? </p></div>

<p> Rajiv has 6 white shirts and <span></span>

<p>If a school has 300 girls and 200 boys, what percent of the students are girls? </p></div>
<div id="a0000008605" class="solution">Solution for Problem 10:</div>
<span><a name="a0000008606"></a>
<p> Avoid the following common mistake: <div class="bogus"> There are 300 girls and 200 boys, so the percent of girls is <div id="a0000008607" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div> </div> This “answer” is clearly incorrect: the percent of girls must be between <span></span>
 (no girls) and <span></span>
 (all girls). The correct solution is that we must compute the percentage of girls from the <em>total</em> number of students. </p><a name="a0000008608"></a>
<p>The school has <span></span>
 total students, so the percent of the students who are girls is </p>

<div probnum="11" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000008612"></a>
<p>An athlete’s target heart rate is <span></span>
 of the theoretical maximum heart rate. The maximum heart rate, in beats per minute, is found by subtracting the athlete’s age, in years, from <span class="mathnumber">220</span>. What is the target heart rate of an athlete who is 26 years old? (Round to the nearest beat per minute.) <span class="source">(Source: AMC 8)</span> </p></div>
<div id="a0000008614" class="solution">Solution for Problem 11:</div>
<span><a name="a0000008615"></a>
<p> This is a 2-step problem. First, we have to find the athlete’s maximum heart rate. Second, we have to find the target heart rate. </p><a name="a0000008616"></a>
<p>To find the maximum heart rate, we simply follow the directions in the problem: we subtract the athlete’s age of 26 from 220, to get <span></span>
. This is the maximum heart rate for a 26-year-old. </p><a name="a0000008617"></a>
<p>Then, we are told that the target heart rate is 80% of the maximum heart rate. So to find the target heart rate, we multiply the maximum heart rate by <span></span>
: </p>
<div id="a0000008619" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008620"></a>
<p> But that’s not the answer—the problem asked us to round to the nearest beat per minute. So we must round <span></span>
 to the nearest integer. We can compute <span></span>
, and the nearest integer to <span class="mathnumber">155.2</span> is <span class="mathnumber">155</span>. Alternatively, we can note that the nearest multiple of 5 to 776 is 775, so the answer is <span></span>
 beats per minute. </p></span>
<div probnum="12" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000008622"></a>
<p>All of the students in Mr. Sato’s History class took an exam. Each student either passed or failed. 85% of the students passed and 3 students failed. How many students are in the class? </p></div>
<div id="a0000008624" class="solution">Solution for Problem 12:</div>
<span><a name="a0000008625"></a>
<p> What bit of information do we need to answer this problem? </p><a name="a0000008626"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> When deciding how to proceed with a problem, ask yourself: “What information do I need to be able to solve the problem?” Then see if you can find that information. </div> </p><a name="a0000008627"></a>
<p>We know that 3 students failed, and it would be nice to know what percent of the total that is. But we <em>do</em> know that! Since the entire class is <span></span>
 of the students, and <span></span>
 of the students passed, we know that <span></span>
 of the students failed. So 3 students equals <span></span>
 of the total number of students in the class. </p><a name="a0000008628"></a>
<p>Let’s set <span class="mathname">n</span> to be the number of students in the class, so that we can write an equation for <span class="mathname">n</span>. </p><a name="a0000008629"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> When trying to find an unknown quantity, it is often useful to assign a variable to that quantity, so that you can write an equation. </div> </p><a name="a0000008630"></a>
<p>Since 3 students is <span></span>
 of the class, we have the equation </p>
<div id="a0000008632" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008633"></a>
<p> Multiplying <span></span>
 by 100 gives <span></span>
, and dividing by 15 gives <span></span>
. Therefore, there are 20 students in the class. </p><a name="a0000008634"></a>
<p>To check our answer, we note that if 3 students failed, then <span></span>
 passed. This must be <span></span>
 of all students, and indeed <span></span>
 of 20 students totals <span></span>
 students. </p></span>
<div probnum="13" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000008636"></a>
<p>Patti takes 200 flowers to her middle school to sell on Valentine’s Day. She first sells 30% of the flowers to <span></span>
 grade students. She then sells 40% of the remaining flowers to <span></span>
 grade students. Finally, she sells 50% of the remaining flowers to <span></span>
 grade students. How many flowers does she have left? </p></div>
<div id="a0000008638" class="solution">Solution for Problem 13:</div>
<span><a name="a0000008639"></a>
<p> Our role in this problem is as an accountant. We need to keep track of her sales during the day. </p><a name="a0000008640"></a>
<p>First, she sells <span></span>
 of her original 200 flowers to the <span></span>
 grade students. We compute <span></span>
, so she sells 60 flowers. This means she has <span></span>
 remaining. </p><a name="a0000008641"></a>
<p>Next, she sells <span></span>
 of her <span class="mathnumber">140</span> remaining flowers to the <span></span>
 grade students. We compute <span></span>
, so she sells 56 flowers. This means she has <span></span>
 remaining. </p><a name="a0000008642"></a>
<p>Next, she sells <span></span>
 of her <span class="mathnumber">84</span> remaining flowers to the <span></span>
 grade students. We compute <span></span>
, so she sells 42 flowers. This means she has <span></span>
 remaining. </p><a name="a0000008643"></a>
<p>So she ends the day with 42 flowers. </p><a name="a0000008644"></a>
<p>We could actually solve this problem in one calculation, by keeping track of how many flowers she <em>keeps</em> at each step. We use the fact that, at each step, the percents of the flowers she sells and the flowers she keeps must sum to 100%. So we know she keeps <span></span>
 of the flowers after the <span></span>
 grade sales, then <span></span>
 of the remaining flowers after the <span></span>
 grade sales, and then <span></span>
 of the remaining flowers after the <span></span>
 grade sales. So, at the end of the day, she keeps </p>

</div><a name="a0000008647"></a>
<p> flowers. </p></span>

<p>A 100-milliliter bottle of salad dressing initially consists of 80% oil and 20% vinegar. 40% of the dressing is used, and then 4 milliliters of vinegar are added to the bottle. What percentage of the mixture is now vinegar? </p></div>
<div id="a0000008651" class="solution">Solution for Problem 14:</div>
<span><a name="a0000008652"></a>
<p> As in the previous problem, our best approach is to keep track of how the various quantities change. </p><a name="a0000008653"></a>
<p>We start by using <span></span>
 of the original <span></span>
 of dressing, which means that <span></span>
 remains. That gives us <span></span>
 of dressing left in the bottle. Since the composition of the dressing hasn’t changed (only the amount has changed), we still have <span></span>
 oil and <span></span>
 vinegar. This means that we have </p>
<div id="a0000008655" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008656"></a>
<p> Next, we add the additional <span></span>
 of vinegar. After this, we still have <span></span>
 of oil, but we have <span></span>
 of vinegar, and the total amount of dressing is <span></span>
. Therefore, the percent of the dressing that is vinegar is </p>
<div id="a0000008658" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008659"></a>
<p> It is no surprise that the new vinegar percentage of <span></span>
 is higher than the original percentage of <span></span>
 vinegar: since we have added vinegar (but not oil), the percent of vinegar relative to the total should be larger. </p></span><a name="a0000008660"></a>
