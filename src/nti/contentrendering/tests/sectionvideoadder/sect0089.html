<p> We certainly don’t want to write out 2010 letters! Fortunately, the letters follow a clear pattern. The same 9-letter block repeats over and over: </p>
<div id="a0000012755" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012756"></a>
<p> We’ll have to write this block over and over many times before reaching the <span>2010</span><sup>th</sup> letter. To figure out how many times, we divide 2010 by 9, which has quotient 223 and remainder 3. So, in writing the first 2010 letters, we write this repeating block 223 times, and then write 3 more letters. Therefore, the <span>2010</span><sup>th</sup> letter is <span class="mathname">C</span>. </p></span><a name="a0000012757"></a>
<p>In Problem <a href="sect0089.html#probsolve:firstpatter">1</a>, the pattern is part of the problem statement. In many problems, the pattern isn’t given in the problem, and we must discover it by experimenting. </p>

<p> Computing <span></span>
 by hand will take a while. Many calculators aren’t able to output all the digits of such a large number, so even using a calculator may not help solve the problem. Instead, we’ll have to play with the problem a bit by computing several powers of 2 and looking for a pattern. Starting from <span></span>
, the first eight powers of 2 are </p>
<div id="a0000012764" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012765"></a>
<p> At first, it may not be obvious that there’s a pattern. But remember, the problem asks for the units digit of <span></span>
, so let’s look at just the units digits of the numbers in this list: </p>
<div id="a0000012767" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012768"></a>
<p> The same block of 4 digits repeats twice. Will this pattern continue forever? <div class="important"> Noticing a pattern isn’t enough. We have to be sure that the pattern continues in order to use it to solve a problem. This usually means that we have to figure out why the pattern occurs. </div> </p><a name="a0000012769"></a>
<p>The units digit of the product of two integers is the same as the units digit of the product of the units digits of the integers. For example, the units digit of <span></span>
 is the same as the units digit of <span></span>
. So, all we have to consider are the units digits of the powers of 2. </p><a name="a0000012770"></a>
<p>We start with 2, and multiplying any number that ends in 2 by 2 gives a number that ends in 4. This means that any 2 in the list of units digits of powers of 2 must be followed by a 4. Similarly, 4 must be followed by 8, and 8 must be followed by 6. Since <span></span>
 ends in 2, the next units digit is 2 again. We already know that after 2 comes 4, after 4 comes 8, and after 8 comes 6. Then, we’re back to 2 yet again. So, we see that the units digits repeat the cycle 2, 4, 8, 6 over and over. </p><a name="a0000012771"></a>
<p>Now our goal is to figure out which digit is <span>2011</span><sup>th</sup> if we repeat the cycle 2, 4, 8, 6 until we have 2011 terms. 2011 divided by 4 has quotient 502 and remainder 3. So, we will write the cycle 502 times, and then write 3 more terms to get to the <span>2011</span><sup>th</sup> term. Therefore, the <span>2011</span><sup>th</sup> term is 8, so the units digit of <span></span>
 is 8. </p><a name="a0000012772"></a>
<p>Notice that we don’t even have to find the quotient when 2011 is divided by 4. All we really care about is the remainder. Since the remainder is 3, we know that to get to the <span>2011</span><sup>th</sup> term, we have to write three more terms after writing the last complete cycle 2, 4, 8, 6. </p></span><a name="a0000012773"></a>
<p>It’s very easy to be off by one term when using patterns to solve a problem as we did in Problem <a href="sect0089.html#prob:patterns2">2</a>. For example, suppose we wanted to find the units digit of <span></span>
. Following our work in the previous problem, we find the remainder when we divide 2000 by 4. The remainder is 0, so do we take the first term in the cycle 2, 4, 8, 6, or do we take the last? </p><a name="a0000012774"></a>
<p>To get to the <span>2000</span><sup>th</sup> term, we write the cycle <span></span>
 times and then write <em>no more extra terms</em>. We write the <span>2000</span><sup>th</sup> term when we write the last term of the cycle for the <span>500</span><sup>th</sup> time. So, the units digit of <span></span>
 is 6. </p><a name="a0000012775"></a>
<p><div class="warning"> Be careful not to be off by one term when using patterns to solve a problem. </div> </p><a name="a0000012776"></a>
<p>One way to check that you’re not off by one is to test small cases. For example, to test our reasoning above for the units digit of <span></span>
, we can consider what happens when 2 is raised to smaller exponents that are multiples of 4. Both <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 end in 6, which gives us more confidence that our answer for <span></span>
 is correct. </p>
<div probnum="3" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000012778"></a>
<p>Michelle’s Number Recycling Machine obeys two rules: </p>

<p>If an inserted number has exactly two digits, compute the sum of the digits. </p></li>
</ol><a name="a0000012782"></a>
<p> The first number Michelle inserts is 1. Then every answer she gets is inserted back into the machine until fifty numbers are inserted. What is the fiftieth number to be inserted? <span class="source">(Source: MOEMS)</span></p></div>
<div id="a0000012784" class="solution">Solution for Problem 3:</div>
<span><a name="a0000012785"></a>
<p> As with the previous problem, we experiment a bit and hope we find a pattern. Following the two given rules, the first several numbers Michelle’s machine produces are </p>
<div id="a0000012787" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012788"></a>
<p> Once the machine produces 1 for a second time, we know that the machine will repeat the first 9 numbers over and over. Since 50 divided by 9 leaves a remainder of 5, the <span>50</span><sup>th</sup> number in the list is the same as the <span>5</span><sup>th</sup> in this repeating block of numbers. This means that the <span>50</span><sup>th</sup> number in the list is 16. </p></span>
<div probnum="4" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000012790"></a>
<p>In the figure below, each row of <span></span>
’s has two more <span></span>

<p> First, we simplify the problem by getting rid of the symbols, and instead write the number of <span></span>
’s in each row. The numbers of <span></span>
’s in the rows are </p>
<div id="a0000012797" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012798"></a>
<p> So, to count all the <span></span>
’s in the first 30 rows, we could add the first 30 positive odd numbers. But instead, let’s add up shorter lists and look for a pattern. <div class="concept"> Considering a simpler version of a problem can help us solve the original problem. </div> </p><a name="a0000012799"></a>
<p>The first 5 such sums are </p>

<p> Each sum is a perfect square! The sum of the first 2 odd numbers is <span></span>
, the sum of the first 3 odd numbers is <span></span>
, the sum of the first 4 odd numbers is <span></span>
, and so on. </p><a name="a0000012803"></a>
<p>We now expect that the sum of the first 30 positive odd numbers is <span></span>
. But we still have to figure out why summing the first <span class="mathname">n</span> positive odd numbers results in <span></span>
. Now that we know what to look for, there are a number of ways to see why it is true. </p><a name="a0000012804"></a>
<p>One way is to use what we learned back on page <a href="sect0007.html#consecutiveintegersquare">Squares</a> about consecutive squares. There, we learned that </p>

<p> The first square is just the first positive odd number: <span></span>

: </p>
