 You probably recognize the bold curve at the right as a <span class="def">circle</span>. This circle consists of all points that are 1 inch from point <span class="mathname">O</span>. Point <span class="mathname">O</span> is called the <a name="a0000010591" id="a0000010591"></a><a name="a0000010592" id="a0000010592"></a><span class="def">center</span> of the circle. Any line segment from the center of a circle to the circle itself is called a <a name="a0000010593" id="a0000010593"></a><span class="def">radius</span> of the circle. So, for example, <span></span>
 is a radius of the circle. We also use the term “radius” to refer to the length of such a segment. So, the radius of the circle at the right is 1 inch. A <a name="a0000010594" id="a0000010594"></a><span class="def">diameter</span> of the circle is a line segment that connects two points on the circle and passes through the center of the circle. As with “radius,” we can also use the word “diameter” to refer to the length of a diameter. The diameter of a circle is twice its radius, since each diameter consists of two radii (“radii” is the plural of radius). </p><a name="a0000010595"></a>
<p><div class="defn"> A <span class="def">circle</span> consists of all points that are a fixed distance, called the <span class="def">radius</span> of the circle, from a given point, called the <span class="def">center</span> of the circle. </div> </p><a name="a0000010596"></a>
<p>The perimeter of a circle is called the circle’s <a name="a0000010597" id="a0000010597"></a><span class="def">circumference</span>. Before reading the rest of this section, try a little experiment. Get a string, and find numerous circular objects. Measure the distance around each object by wrapping the string around it. Then measure the diameter of the object. Finally, for each object find the quotient </p>
<div id="a0000010599" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000010600"></a>
<p> You should find that in each case the quotient is a little more than 3. (If you get anything much different, try measuring and dividing again!) </p><a name="a0000010601"></a>
<p>In every circle, the circumference divided by the diameter equals the same number. This special number is called <span class="def">pi</span> and is almost always written as the Greek letter <a name="a0000010602" id="a0000010602"></a><span></span>
, pronounced “pie.” Just as with <span></span>
, we can’t write a decimal number that equals <span></span>
, but we can approximate <span></span>
. To the nearest hundredth, <span></span>
 rounds to 3.14. </p><a name="a0000010603"></a>

<p> For some reason, memorizing huge portions of <span></span>
 is a bit of a sport among math-lovers. This should help you get started:  </p><a name="a0000010605"></a>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582 0974944592307816406286208998628034825342117067982148086 5132823066470938446095505822317253594081284811174502841 027019385211055596446229489549303819644288109756<span></span>
</tt></p><a name="a0000010606"></a>
<p> (Please don’t tell your parents you got this <span></span>
-memorizing idea from us.) </p></div> </p><a name="a0000010607"></a>
<p>Like <span></span>
, pi is an <a name="a0000010608" id="a0000010608"></a><a name="a0000010609" id="a0000010609"></a><span class="def">irrational number</span>. Its decimal expansion does not terminate and does not ever get to the point where the same set of numbers is repeated over and over. So, there are no shortcuts to memorizing digits of pi! (To be clear, there’s no good reason to be memorizing tons of digits of <span></span>
—some people just find it fun.) </p><a name="a0000010610"></a>
<p><a name="a0000010611" id="a0000010611"></a><a name="a0000010612" id="a0000010612"></a> In addition to the circumference of a circle, the area of a circle is also related to <span></span>
: </p><a name="a0000010613"></a>
<p><div class="important"> The area of a circle with radius <span class="mathname">r</span> is <span></span>
. </div> </p><a name="a0000010614"></a>
<p>We can get a sense for why this formula is true by slicing up a circle and rearranging the pieces. On the left below, we have a circle with radius <span class="mathname">r</span> that is divided into 16 equal pieces by 16 equally spaced radii. These pieces are called <a name="a0000010615" id="a0000010615"></a><span class="def">sectors</span>. </p>
<div class="align-center"><img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/geometry_81.pdf}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000010617"></a>
<p>Next, we rearrange the sectors as shown in the second figure above. Then, we take half of one of the end sectors and slide it to the other end as shown in the final figure on the right above. This final figure resembles a rectangle. </p><a name="a0000010618"></a>
<p>The circumference of the original circle is equally divided among the top and bottom of our “rectangle.” So, the “length” of the “rectangle” is half the circumference of the circle, which is <span></span>
. The “width” of the “rectangle” is simply the radius of the circle, which is <span class="mathname">r</span>. </p><a name="a0000010619"></a>
<p>Since the area of a rectangle is its length times its width, the area of our “rectangle” is <span></span>
. The “rectangle” is composed of the exact same pieces as our original circle, so the area of the circle is the same as the area of the “rectangle.” This isn’t a completely accurate explanation for why the area of the original circle is <span></span>
, since the “rectangle” isn’t exactly a rectangle. But, hopefully it gives you some intuition for why the formula is true. <a name="a0000010620" id="a0000010620"></a><a name="a0000010621" id="a0000010621"></a> </p><div id="a0000010622" class="section-problems"><span class="headingtext">Section Problems</span></div>

<div id="a0000010634" class="solution">Solution for Problem 13:</div>
<span><a name="a0000010635"></a>
<p> Since the circumference of a circle divided by the circle’s diameter is <span></span>
, the circumference of a circle is always <span></span>
 times the diameter of the circle. So, a circle with circumference <span></span>
 centimeters has diameter <span class="mathnumber">54</span> centimeters. Therefore, the radius of the circle is <span></span>
 centimeters. </p></span><a name="a0000010636"></a>

<div id="a0000010640" class="solution">Solution for Problem 14:</div>
<span><a name="a0000010641"></a>
<p> First, we find the area of the region we can paint with 1 gallon. A circle with diameter 10 meters has radius 5 meters, so its area is <span></span>
 square meters. Since 1 gallon can cover <span></span>
 square meters, we know that 4 gallons can cover <span></span>
 square meters. Let <span class="mathname">r</span> be the radius in meters of the largest circle we can paint with 4 gallons. Then, we must have <span></span>
, so <span></span>
, which means <span></span>
. The radius of the new circle is <span class="mathnumber">10</span> meters, so the new circle’s diameter is <span></span>
 meters. </p></span><a name="a0000010642"></a>
<p>In Problem <a href="sect0064.html#prob:basicarea">14</a>, we saw that doubling the radius (or diameter) of a circle multiplies its area by 4. Similarly, suppose we start with a circle that has radius <span class="mathname">r</span> and then multiply the radius by <span class="mathname">k</span> to make a new circle. The area of the original circle is <span></span>
. The area of the new circle is <span></span>

 times the area of the original circle. </p><a name="a0000010643"></a>

<p>We start with a diagram. The rectangle at the right is my house, and Cassidy’s leash is connected at corner <span class="mathname">A</span>. Since the leash is 20 feet long, Cassidy can reach any point outside the house that is within 20 feet of point <span class="mathname">A</span>. So, Cassidy can reach any outside point that is inside the circle centered at <span class="mathname">A</span> with radius 20 feet. This region is shaded in the diagram; Cassidy can’t reach the quarter of the circle that is inside the house. She can roam throughout the <span></span>
 of the circle that is outside the house. The area of this region is </p>
<div id="a0000010656" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div></li>
</ol>
<ol class="parts itemize">
	<li class="part"><a name="a0000010658"></a>
<p>As in the previous part, Cassidy can roam throughout <span></span>
 of a circular region with radius <span class="mathnumber">50</span> feet, which is the large darkly-shaded region in the diagram below. This region is <span></span>
 of a circle with radius <span class="mathnumber">50</span> feet. The area of this region is </p>
<div id="a0000010660" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000010661"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_84.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 However, because Cassidy’s leash is longer than each side of my house, she can go around two other corners of my house. Since the length of my house is <span class="mathnumber">40</span> feet, when Cassidy reaches point <span class="mathname">B</span>, she has another 10 feet of leash. So, she can reach any outside point that is within 10 feet of <span class="mathname">B</span>. This means she can reach any point in an additional quarter-circular region at point <span class="mathname">B</span> with radius 10 feet. This region is shaded lightly in the diagram. The area of this region is <span></span>
 the area of a full circle with radius 10, or </p>

<p>Similarly, the width of my house is 30 feet, so when Cassidy gets to point <span class="mathname">C</span>, she has another 20 feet of leash. Therefore, she can reach any point in a quarter-circular region at point <span class="mathname">C</span> with radius 20 feet. This region is also shaded lightly in the diagram.

<p>Sometimes we have to be quite creative to find the area of an oddly-shaped region. </p><a name="a0000010673"></a>

 Two quarter-circles are drawn with their centers at opposite vertices of a square, as shown at the right. If the side length of the square is 6, then what is the area of the shaded region between the quarter-circles?<br> </div> </p>
<div id="a0000010675" class="solution">Solution for Problem 16:</div>
<span><a name="a0000010676"></a>
<p> Here are a couple different ways to tackle this problem: </p><a name="a0000010677"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_104.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 <em>Method 1: Break the shaded region into pieces.</em> We label our square <span class="mathname">ABCD</span>, and draw diagonal <span></span>
 to split the shaded region into two identical pieces. Now, we just have to find the area of one shaded piece, and then we can double that area to get our answer. </p><a name="a0000010678"></a>
<p> <div class="leftpic"><img alt="\leftpic{geometry_105.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 Each shaded piece is what remains after we remove an isosceles right triangle from a quarter-circle. The radius of the quarter-circle is 6, so its area is <span></span>
. Both legs of the right triangle have length 6, so the area of the right triangle is <span></span>
. So, we have</p>
<div id="a0000010680" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000010681"></a>
<p> Therefore, the area of the shaded piece is <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000010682"></a>
<p>We have to be careful! The original shaded region consists of two pieces like the one whose area we just found. So, the area of the original shaded region is </p>
<div id="a0000010684" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000010685"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_324.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 <em>Method 2: Creative overcounting!</em> Imagine we paint each quarter-circular region gray. When we do so, we will paint the overlap region twice, so it will end up darker than the once-painted regions, as shown in the diagram at the right. That is, while painting the two semi-circles, we paint the entire square once and give the darkly-shaded region a second coat of paint. So, we have: </p>
<div id="a0000010687" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000010688"></a>
<p> Rearranging this gives us </p>
<div id="a0000010690" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000010691"></a>
<p> As we saw above, each quarter-circle has area <span></span>
, so the two together have an area of <span></span>
. The area of the square is <span></span>
, so the area of the darkly-shaded region is <span></span>
. </p></span><div id="a0000010692" class="exercises"><span class="headingtext">Exercises</span></div>
