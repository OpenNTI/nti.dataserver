<p> Recall that we use the endpoints to label the segment. For example, <span></span>
 is the segment from <span class="mathname">A</span> to <span class="mathname">B</span>. To refer to the length of the segment, we omit the bar. For example, if you measure <span></span>
 in Figure <a href="sec-perimeter.html#fig:itsasegment2">11.1</a> with a ruler, you’ll find that <a name="a0000010341" id="a0000010341"></a><span class="mathname">AB</span> equals 2 inches. We often leave out the units in geometry problems. So, for example, we might write <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000010342"></a>
<p>One special point on a segment is the segment’s <span class="def">midpoint</span>, which is the point halfway between the endpoints. </p>

<p>One way to measure a closed figure is by the total length of its boundary. We call this the <span class="def">perimeter</span> of the figure.

<div id="a0000010361" class="solution">Solution for Problem 1:</div>
<span><a name="a0000010362"></a>
<p> We could figure out the length of each bit of fence, and then add up all these lengths. But there’s a more clever solution. Suppose the farmer started at the upper right corner, point <span class="mathname">P</span> in the diagram on the right, and walked clockwise all the way around the region along the fence. His path will always take him directly down, left, up, or right on our diagram. He’ll walk downward along 5 squares and back up along 5 squares. Similarly, he’ll walk 7 squares to the left and 7 squares to the right. So, in total, he walks along </p>
<div id="a0000010364" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000010365"></a>
<p> sides of the squares. Each of the 24 side lengths is 10 feet, so he walks 240 feet. The fence costs <span></span>
 per foot, so Fred’s fence costs <span></span>
.</p></span><a name="a0000010366"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_205.pdf}" align="bottom">

 Another quick way to find the length of the fence is to rearrange the fence into a simpler shape. We do so by moving the parts of the fence that are inside the grid out to the boundary of the grid, as shown on the right. The old path of the fence inside the grid is shown in gray. The new path is clearly a rectangle, whose perimeter we can quickly find. The top and the bottom of the rectangle are congruent, and the left and the right sides are congruent. As before, we find that the perimeter is a total of <span></span>
 side lengths of the squares in the original diagram. </p><a name="a0000010367"></a>

 Opposite sides of a rectangle are congruent. We often call the lengths of adjacent sides of a rectangle the <a name="a0000010368" id="a0000010368"></a><a name="a0000010369" id="a0000010369"></a><a name="a0000010370" id="a0000010370"></a><span class="def">length</span> and the <span class="def">width</span> of the rectangle.

</div><a name="a0000010408"></a>
<p>  Simplifying the left side gives <span></span>

<p>In Problems <a href="sec-perimeter.html#cGeometry:equil">2</a> and <a href="sec-perimeter.html#cGeometry:isosceles">4</a>, we introduced equilateral triangles and isosceles triangles. An equilateral triangle is also an isosceles triangle. That is, “isosceles” does not mean that the base must have a different length than the legs.

<p>Mary and Jeff will be farthest apart at lunchtime if they walk in opposite directions. If they walk in opposite directions, they will be <span></span>

 </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000010424"></a>
<p>We can view this as essentially the same as the previous part. The side of length 7 represents Mary’s hike and the side of length 4 represents Jeff’s hike. If we let the distance between Mary and Jeff at lunchtime be the length of the third side, then part (a) tells us that the third side length cannot be more than 11. Therefore, if the lengths of two sides of a triangle are 4 and 7, then the third side length cannot possibly be 12. Similarly, no triangle can have side lengths 4, 7 and 11. </p></li>
</ol>
<ol class="parts itemize">
	<li class="part"><a name="a0000010426"></a>
<p>We can think about this the same way as we did the previous two parts. Suppose Mary starts from home and hikes <span class="mathname">a</span> miles while Jeff starts from the same home and hikes <span class="mathname">b</span> miles. The farthest apart they can be at the end of their hikes is <span></span>
 miles. So, if <span></span>
, they can’t possibly be <span class="mathname">c</span> miles apart. </p><a name="a0000010427"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_320.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 As in part (b), we can consider Mary’s hike to be one side of a triangle, Jeff’s hike to be another side of the triangle, and the segment connecting the endpoints of their hikes to be the third side of the triangle. So, the vertices of this triangle are the endpoints of the two hikes and the home where they both began. Mary and Jeff can’t be more than <span></span>
 apart at lunchtime, so the third side length of this triangle can’t possibly be longer than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. Similarly, it is impossible for any triangle to have side lengths <span class="mathname">a</span>, <span class="mathname">b</span>, and <span class="mathname">c</span> if <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000010428"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_319.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 Next, we consider whether or not we can have <span></span>
. The only way Mary’s and Jeff’s hikes can end <span></span>
 miles apart is if they walk in opposite directions. This means that their home is on the segment connecting the endpoints of their hikes. In other words, the “triangle” is just a line segment, as shown in the diagram. So, we cannot make a triangle with side lengths <span class="mathname">a</span>, <span class="mathname">b</span>, <span class="mathname">c</span> if <span></span>

<p>I am drawing a picture on a 12 inch by 16 inch rectangular piece of paper for my art class. My teacher tells me that I must leave a 1 inch margin on all sides of the paper, since that region will be covered by the frame. What is the perimeter of the region in which I can still draw? </p></li><li><a name="a0000010437"></a>
