<p>Speed is just a special example of a <span class="def">rate</span>. Whenever a quantity changes by a certain amount in a fixed unit of time, we have a rate.

<p>Just as with speed, the use of the word “per” is likely a signal that we are working with a rate. Also, just as with speed, we can use the units to our advantage when solving problems involving rates. </p><a name="a0000008041"></a>
<p>Here is a basic example: </p>
<div probnum="28" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000008043"></a>
<p>Jason can type at a rate of 40 words per minute. How long will it take him to type a <span></span>
 word essay? </p></div>
<div id="a0000008045" class="solution">Solution for Problem 28:</div>
<span><a name="a0000008046"></a>
<p><em>Method 1: Direct reasoning.</em> Jason needs to type 2000 words, and for every 40 words that he will type, he will need 1 minute. Therefore, he needs <span></span>
 minutes to type the entire 2000 words. </p><a name="a0000008047"></a>
<p><em>Method 2: Conversion factor.</em> Jason’s typing essentially converts “minutes” into “words” and vice versa, so we can use a conversion factor. We need to arrange the data so that the “words” units cancel and we are left with “minutes” units: </p>
<div id="a0000008049" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008050"></a>
<p>So it takes Jason 50 minutes to type the essay. We can also easily check this answer: if he types for 50 minutes, and he types 40 words per minute, then he will type a total of </p>
<div id="a0000008052" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008053"></a>
<p> as required. </p></span><a name="a0000008054"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> Use the units in your mathematical expressions to help you figure out how to use the information in the problem. </div> </p>
<div probnum="29" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000008056"></a>
<p>A hose fills a swimming pool at a rate of 0.5 gallons per second. If the pool’s capacity is <span></span>
 gallons, then how many hours does it take for the hose to completely fill an empty pool? </p></div>
<div id="a0000008058" class="solution">Solution for Problem 29:</div>
<span><a name="a0000008059"></a>
<p> First, we can compute how many seconds are necessary. This is just a basic conversion problem: </p>
<div id="a0000008061" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008062"></a>
<p> We can also convert seconds to hours using conversion factors. This gives </p>
<div id="a0000008064" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008065"></a>
<p> Thus it will take 5 hours to fill the pool. </p></span><a name="a0000008066"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> Unit conversions are just another type of rate. We can work with rates much like we do conversion factors. In particular, use them in mathematical expressions so that the units cancel in the way that you want. </div> </p>
<div probnum="30" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000008068"></a>
<p>Julie wants to give a 45-minute speech, and she speaks 120 words per minute. Her written notes contain 500 words per page. How many pages should she prepare? </p></div>
<div id="a0000008070" class="solution">Solution for Problem 30:</div>
<span><a name="a0000008071"></a>
<p> We have a couple of different rates here: both the words per minute and the words per page. We could do this as a two-step problem, or use both rates at once. </p><a name="a0000008072"></a>
<p><em>Method 1: Count words first, then count pages.</em> First, we compute how many words should be in the speech. Julie wants to talk for 45 minutes and she’ll use 120 words per minute, so she will speak <span></span>
 words. Then, we compute the number of pages: 5400 words at 500 words per page will require <span></span>
 pages. </p><a name="a0000008073"></a>
<p><em>Method 2: Do all at once using conversion factors.</em> We write an expression that cancels the units we don’t want and leaves the unit we do want: </p>
<div id="a0000008075" class="math equation">

<div probnum="31" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000008077"></a>
<p>Rajiv’s car has tires that have circumference 75 inches. (The <em>circumference</em> of a tire is the distance around the outside of the tire.) How many revolutions will his tires make if Rajiv drives to a store that is <span></span>
 mile away? (Assume that the drive is completely straight, and recall that 1 mile is <span></span>
 feet.) </p></div>
<div id="a0000008079" class="solution">Solution for Problem 31:</div>
<span><a name="a0000008080"></a>
<p> We can set this up as a product of conversion factors: </p>
<div id="a0000008082" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div></span><a name="a0000008083"></a>
<p>Work problems are another particular type of rate problem. Here is a classic (if slightly confusing) example: </p>
<div probnum="32" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000008085"></a>
<p>If 5 woodchucks could chuck 50 cords of wood in 4 days, then how many cords of wood could 7 woodchucks chuck in 6 days? </p></div>
<div id="a0000008087" class="solution">Solution for Problem 32:</div>
<span><a name="a0000008088"></a>
<p> What information would be most useful? It would be helpful if we knew how much wood 1 woodchuck could chuck in 1 day. Fortunately it is not too difficult to figure this out. </p><a name="a0000008089"></a>
<p>If </p>
<div id="a0000008091" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008092"></a>
<p> and since 1 woodchuck chucks <span></span>
 as much wood as 5 woodchucks, then we know that </p>
<div id="a0000008094" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008095"></a>
<p> Then, since a woodchuck can chuck <span></span>
 as much wood in 1 day as she can chuck in 4 days, we conclude that </p>
<div id="a0000008097" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008098"></a>
<p>Now we use this to answer our problem. If </p>
<div id="a0000008100" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008101"></a>
<p> then </p>
<div id="a0000008103" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008104"></a>
<p> and thus </p>
<div id="a0000008106" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008107"></a>
<p> Thus the answer is <span></span>
 cords of wood. </p></span>
<div probnum="33" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000008109"></a>
<p>Tom can paint Mr. Thatcher’s fence in 6 hours, while Huck can paint Mr. Thatcher’s fence in 5 hours. If they work together, then how long will it take them to paint the fence?<a name="prob:workprob"></a> </p></div>
<div id="a0000008111" class="solution">Solution for Problem 33:</div>
<span><a name="a0000008112"></a>
<p> Our plan is to determine their work rates, and then add them. In particular, Tom can paint <span></span>
 of a fence per hour, and Huck can paint <span></span>
 of a fence per hour. So, together they can paint <span></span>
 of a fence per hour. Therefore, the time to paint the whole fence is </p>
<div id="a0000008114" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008115"></a>
<p> or a little over <span class="mathnumber">2.7</span> hours. </p></span><a name="a0000008116"></a>
<p>The key step in our solution to Problem <a href="sect0047.html#prob:workprob">33</a> was considering how much work Tom and Huck each do per hour. </p><a name="a0000008117"></a>
