<a name="a0000006346"></a>
<p>In this chapter, we learned how to solve <span class="def">one-variable linear equations</span>. By “solving” an equation, we mean finding all values of the variable for which the equation is true. The “one-variable” in “one-variable linear equation” means that only one variable appears in the equation, though it may appear multiple times. The “linear” means that every term in the equation is a constant term or is a constant times the first power of the variable. </p><a name="a0000006347"></a>
<p>We say that we <span class="def">solve</span> an equation when we find all values of the variable that make the equation true. The two most important tactics we use to solve equations are: </p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li value="1"><a name="a0000006349"></a>
<p><em>We can replace any expression with an equivalent expression</em>. For example, in the equation </p>
<div id="a0000006351" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006352"></a>
<p> we can simplify the left-hand side to <span></span>
, so the equation becomes </p>
<div id="a0000006354" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div></li><li value="2"><a name="a0000006355"></a>
<p><em>We can perform the same mathematical operation to both sides of the equation</em>. For example, starting with the equation <span></span>
, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to get </p>
<div id="a0000006357" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006358"></a>
<p> Simplifying both sides of the equation then gives <span></span>
, and we have found the solution to the equation. Looking back to the original equation, <span></span>
, we see that when we have <span></span>
, we get <span></span>
, which is indeed a true equation. </p></li>
</ol><a name="a0000006359"></a>
<p><div class="important"> When solving an equation, we can check our answer by substituting it back into the original equation. If the original equation is not satisfied by our answer, then we made a mistake. </div> </p><a name="a0000006360"></a>
<p><div class="important"> If a linear equation can be manipulated into an equation that is never true (such as <span></span>
), then there are no solutions to the equation. Similarly, if a linear equation can be manipulated into an equation that is always true (such as <span></span>
), then all possible values of the variable are solutions to the original equation. </div> </p><a name="a0000006361"></a>
<p>We can often solve word problems by turning them into linear equations. </p><a name="a0000006362"></a>
<p><div class="important"> The key to solving word problems is converting the words into the language of mathematics. To do so, assign a variable to be a quantity you seek. Then, try to build an equation to solve for that variable. </div> </p><a name="a0000006363"></a>
<p><div class="warning"> When solving a word problem, define your variable clearly and use it exactly as you’ve defined it. </div> </p><a name="a0000006364"></a>
<p>The statement <span></span>
 means that <span class="mathname">x</span> is greater than <span class="mathname">y</span>. Similarly, <span></span>
 means that <span class="mathname">x</span> is less than <span class="mathname">y</span>. Both <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 are <span class="def">inequalities</span>. More specifically, they are strict inequalities, because in both cases we cannot have <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000006365"></a>
<p>We can also write nonstrict inequalities, such as <span></span>
, which means that <span class="mathname">x</span> is greater than or equal to <span class="mathname">y</span>. Similarly, <span></span>
 means that <span class="mathname">x</span> is less than or equal to <span class="mathname">y</span>. </p><a name="a0000006366"></a>
<p><div class="important"><a name="a0000006367"></a>
<p> Here are several useful rules regarding ways in which we can manipulate inequalities: </p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li><a name="a0000006369"></a>
<p>If <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, then <span></span>
. </p></li><li><a name="a0000006370"></a>
<p>If <span></span>
, then <span></span>
 for any number <span class="mathname">c</span>. If we also have <span></span>
, then <span></span>
. </p></li><li><a name="a0000006371"></a>
<p>If <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, then <span></span>
. </p></li>
</ul></div> </p><a name="a0000006372"></a>
<p><div class="important"> If we multiply or divide an inequality by a negative number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality. For example, if <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, then <span></span>
. </div> </p><a name="a0000006373"></a>
<p> Similar rules hold for nonstrict inequalities. For example, if <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, then <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000006374"></a>
<p> <div class="warning"> Inequality rules that work when all the variables are positive don’t always work when some of the variables are negative! Be careful when dealing with negative numbers (or expressions that can be negative) in inequalities. </div> </p></div>
