<p>Danielle chooses a number. She multiplies it by 3, then adds 6, then divides by 3, and finally subtracts 6. Her end result is 4. What number did she choose?<a name="prob:dani"></a> </p></div>
<div id="a0000012998" class="solution">Solution for Problem 13:</div>
<span><a name="a0000012999"></a>
<p> Just for fun, let’s try working this problem “forwards.” Let <span class="mathname">x</span> be Danielle’s number. We build an expression step by step for her final number: </p>
<div class="align-center"> <div class="tabular"><img alt="\begin{tabular}{c|c} Danielle’s action  &amp;  Resulting expression  \\ \hline Multiply by 3  &amp; $3x$  \\ Add 6  &amp; $3x+6$  \\ Divide by 3  &amp; $(3x+6)/3$  \\ Subtract 6  &amp; $(3x+6)/3-6$   \end{tabular}" align="bottom">
</div> </div><a name="a0000013001"></a>
<p> We know that this final number must equal 4, so we have an equation: </p>
<div id="a0000013003" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000013004"></a>
<p>It would be awfully easy to make a mistake while setting up or solving this equation. Let’s try going backwards and see if that’s easier. </p><a name="a0000013005"></a>
<p>We’ll start with the end result, 4, and we’ll go backwards through the steps, undoing each. For example, Danielle’s last step was “subtract 6.” Going backwards, we add 6 to see that Danielle’s number was 10 before she subtracted 6. Here’s what we find when we start with 4 and go backwards through the steps, undoing each: </p>
<div class="align-center"> <div class="tabular"><img alt="\begin{tabular}{c|c|c} Danielle’s action  &amp;  Undo action   &amp;  Resulting number  \\ \hline Subtract 6  &amp; Add 6   &amp;  10  \\ Divide by 3  &amp; Multiply by 3   &amp;  30  \\ Add 6  &amp; Subtract 6  &amp;  24  \\ Multiply by 3  &amp; Divide by 3  &amp;  8   \end{tabular}" align="bottom">
</div> </div><a name="a0000013007"></a>
<p>Therefore, Danielle started with 8. (Note that <span></span>
 satisfies our earlier equation.) </p></span><a name="a0000013008"></a>
<p>Our “work backwards” solution to Problem <a href="sect0092.html#prob:dani">13</a> is closely related to solving the equation we wrote for the problem. Here’s the equation we wrote for the problem: </p>
<div id="a0000013010" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000013011"></a>
<p> Now, let’s go through the “Undo actions” from our table, in order: </p>
<div class="align-center"> <div class="tabular"><img alt="\begin{tabular}{c|c} Undo action   &amp;  Resulting equation  \\ \hline  Add 6   &amp;  $\dfrac{3x+6}{3} = 10$  \\  Multiply by 3   &amp;  $3x+6 = 30$  \\ Subtract 6  &amp;  $3x=24$  \\ Divide by 3  &amp;  $x=8$   \end{tabular}" align="bottom">
</div> </div><a name="a0000013013"></a>
<p> So, our “working backwards” is essentially just solving the equation without writing the equation in the first place! </p>

<p>The surface of a pond is being covered by oil leaking from a pipeline. The amount of surface area covered by the oil is doubling each day. At this rate, the surface of the pond will be completely covered with oil at the end of the twenty-fifth day. What fraction of the surface area of the pond will be covered by oil at the end of 20 days? <span class="source">(Source: MATHCOUNTS)</span></p></div>
<div id="a0000013017" class="solution">Solution for Problem 14:</div>
<span><a name="a0000013018"></a>
<p> What’s wrong with this solution: <div class="bogus"> Since 20 days is <span></span>
 of the number of days it takes to cover the whole pond, <span></span>
 of the pond must be covered at the end of 20 days. </div> This solution assumes that the amount the oil spreads each day is the same. But that’s not the case! For example, on the fourth day the amount covered by oil doubles, which means that it increases by the same amount as was covered on all three previous days <em>combined</em>. </p><a name="a0000013019"></a>
<p>The portion of the pond covered doubles each day when going forwards in time. So, if we go backwards in time, the amount of the pond covered is halved each day. Since the pond is completely covered at the end of the twenty-fifth day, <span></span>
 is covered at the end of the twenty-fourth day. Going back another day, the portion covered at the end of the twenty-third day is <span></span>
. Similarly, we have: </p>
<div class="align-center"> <div class="tabular"><img alt="\begin{tabular}{c|c} End of Day   &amp;  Portion Covered  \\ \hline 25   &amp;  1  \\ 24   &amp;  $\frac12\vphantom {\dfrac12}$  \\ 23  &amp;  $\frac14\vphantom {\dfrac12}$  \\ 22  &amp;  $\frac18\vphantom {\dfrac12}$  \\ 21  &amp;  $\frac{1}{16}\vphantom {\dfrac12}$  \\ 20  &amp;  $\frac{1}{32}\vphantom {\dfrac12}$   \end{tabular}" align="bottom">

<p>Alice gave Bob as many dollars as Bob had. Bob then gave Alice as many dollars as Alice then had. At this point, each had 24 dollars. How much did Alice have at the beginning? </p></div>
<div id="a0000013025" class="solution">Solution for Problem 15:</div>
<span><a name="a0000013026"></a>
<p> Solving this with algebra would require two variables and great care in setting up equations. Let’s try going backwards. They both finish with <span></span>
. In the final step, Alice receives as much money as she has. So, she doubles her money to end up with <span></span>
. Therefore, she must have previously had only <span></span>
, and Bob gave her <span></span>
 more. Since Bob has <span></span>
 dollars after giving Alice <span></span>
, he must have had <span></span>
 before giving Alice any money. </p><a name="a0000013027"></a>
<p>Going back one more step, we know that Alice has <span></span>
 and Bob has <span></span>
 after Alice gives Bob money. Since Alice gave Bob as much money as Bob already had, Bob doubled his money to get to <span></span>
. Therefore, he originally had <span></span>
 before Alice gave him <span></span>
 more. Alice had <span></span>
 after giving the <span></span>
 to Bob, so she started with <span></span>
 dollars. </p><a name="a0000013028"></a>
<p><div class="important"> It’s particularly important to check our answer when working backwards to solve a complicated problem. We can usually do so by using our answer and working forwards through the problem. </div> </p><a name="a0000013029"></a>

 and Bob with <span></span>
 does indeed end with both of them having <span></span>

<p>All four of these problems have one key feature in common. Each tells a story in which we know the end, and are trying to figure out what the situation was sometime earlier. This is a huge clue to try working backwards from the known end situation. </p><a name="a0000013033"></a>

<p>In a sequence of five integers, the third integer is the sum of the previous two, the fourth integer is the sum of the previous three, and the fifth integer is the sum of the previous four.

<div id="a0000013037" class="solution">Solution for Problem 16:</div>
<span><a name="a0000013038"></a>
<p> We know something about the end situation, so let’s work backwards. The sum of all five integers is 248. But the sum of the first four integers equals the fifth integer. So, the sum of the first five integers is double the fifth integer. Therefore, the fifth integer is <span></span>
 and the sum of the first four integers is 124. </p><a name="a0000013039"></a>
<p>Similarly, the fourth integer is the sum of the first three integers, so the sum of the first four integers is double the fourth integer. This makes the fourth integer <span></span>
, and the sum of the first three integers is also 62. </p><a name="a0000013040"></a>
<p>We take one more step backwards. The third integer is the sum of the first two integers, so the sum of the first three integers is double the third integer. Therefore, the third integer is <span></span>
