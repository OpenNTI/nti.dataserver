<p>The students in Mrs. Reed’s English class are reading the same 760-page novel. Three friends, Alice, Bob, and Chandra, are in the class. Alice reads a page in 20 seconds, Bob reads a page in 45 seconds, and Chandra reads a page in 30 seconds. </p>

<p>If Bob and Chandra both read the whole book, then Bob will spend how many more seconds reading than Chandra? </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000008189"></a>
<p>Chandra and Bob, who each have a copy of the book, decide that they can save time by “team reading” the novel. In this scheme, Chandra will read from page 1 to a certain page and Bob will read from the next page through page 760, finishing the book. When they are through, they will tell each other about the parts they read. What is the last page that Chandra should read so that she and Bob spend the same amount of time reading the novel?   </p><span class="hint"><a href="#" onclick="return togglehint(event)">Hint: </a><span class="hint content hidden"> If we know what fraction of the book Chandra reads, then we can figure out how many pages she reads. <a name="a0000008190"></a>

<p>Before Chandra and Bob start reading, Alice says she would like to team read with them. If they divide the book into three sections so that each reads for the same length of time, then how many seconds will each have to read? </p></li>
