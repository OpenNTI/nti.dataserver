<p>We start with a problem in which drawing a picture is a pretty obvious first step. </p>
<div probnum="8" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000012937"></a>

<p> At the right, the solid arrows show Wally’s path. As shown in the dashed right triangle, Wally wanders 9 miles north and 12 miles west in total. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem, or recalling the <span></span>
 Pythagorean triple, we find that Wally ends 15 miles from where he started. </p></span>
<div probnum="9" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000012943"></a>
<p>A frog is at the bottom of a 12-meter well. Each morning he climbs up 5 meters. Each night he slides down 3 meters. If he starts climbing on a Sunday, on which day will he reach the top of the well and escape?</p></div>
<div id="a0000012945" class="solution">Solution for Problem 9:</div>
<span><a name="a0000012946"></a>
<p> What’s wrong with this solution: <div class="bogus"> Since he climbs up 5 meters each morning and slides back 3 meters each night, he moves upward 2 meters total each day of the week. Therefore, he will climb 12 meters in <span></span>
 days. He starts climbing on a Sunday, so his sixth day of climbing is the following Friday. </div> </p><a name="a0000012947"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{probsolve_3.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 We see the flaw in this reasoning when we draw a picture that shows both his climbs and his slides. Our picture is shown at the right. We draw up arrows for the climbs and down arrows for the slides, and note the total height climbed at each step. We see that his height first goes over 12 meters after the fifth climb, so he escapes the well on the fifth day of climbing. He starts climbing on a Sunday, so his fifth and last day of climbing is a Thursday. </p></span><a name="a0000012948"></a>

<p> We need a good way to organize the information in the problem. Each piece of information eliminates possibilities. For example, because Bernoulli finished between Abel and Descartes, we know that Bernoulli did not finish first or last. We visualize this information by making a table with a row for each racer and a column for each position. We place X’s in the <span>1</span><sup>st</sup> and <span>4</span><sup>th</sup> columns of Bernoulli’s row to indicate that Bernoulli didn’t finish in either of these positions. </p><a name="a0000012955"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic parpic"><div class="tabular"><img alt="\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c|}&amp; \nst{1}  &amp; \nnd{2}  &amp; \nrd{3}  &amp; \nth{4}  \\ \hline Abel  &amp; X  &amp; \phantom{O}  &amp; \phantom{O}  &amp; \phantom{O}  \\ \hline Bernoulli  &amp; X  &amp; \phantom{O}  &amp; \phantom{O}  &amp; X  \\ \hline Cantor  &amp; \phantom{O}  &amp; \phantom{O}  &amp; \phantom{O}  &amp; X  \\ \hline Descartes  &amp; \phantom{O}  &amp; \phantom{O}  &amp; \phantom{O}  &amp; X  \\ \end{tabular}" align="bottom">
</div></div> Next, we place an X in Cantor’s <span>4</span><sup>th</sup> column since Cantor wasn’t last. Because Descartes beat Abel, we know that Abel wasn’t first and Descartes wasn’t last. Placing X’s for these facts as well, we now have the table at the right. </p><a name="a0000012956"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic parpic"><div class="tabular"><img alt="\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c|}&amp; \nst{1}  &amp; \nnd{2}  &amp; \nrd{3}  &amp; \nth{4}  \\ \hline Abel  &amp; X  &amp; X  &amp; X  &amp; O  \\ \hline Bernoulli  &amp; X  &amp; \phantom{O}  &amp; X  &amp; X  \\ \hline Cantor  &amp; X  &amp; X  &amp; O  &amp; X  \\ \hline Descartes  &amp; \phantom{O}  &amp; \phantom{O}  &amp; X  &amp; X  \\ \end{tabular}" align="bottom">
</div></div> Now, it’s clear that Abel must have been <span>4</span><sup>th</sup>, since none of the other runners could have been <span>4</span><sup>th</sup>. We then immediately know that Cantor was <span>3</span><sup>rd</sup>, since no one was between Cantor and Abel. We place O’s in Abel’s <span>4</span><sup>th</sup> column and Cantor’s <span>3</span><sup>rd</sup> column to indicate that we know these placements. We then can place X’s in the remainder of Abel’s and Cantor’s rows, and in the remainder of the <span>3</span><sup>rd</sup> column. </p><a name="a0000012957"></a>

</div></div> Now we have the full story. There’s only one possibility left for Bernoulli, <span>2</span><sup>nd</sup> place, and only Descartes could have been in <span>1</span><sup>st</sup> place. The completed chart is shown at the left, and the order of the racers was </p>

<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012960"></a>
<p> We can check our answer by making sure that this order agrees with all the information in the problem. In the finishing order we found above, Bernoulli is between Abel and Descartes. Cantor is not last, Descartes beats Abel, and no one is between Cantor and Abel. </p></span>

<p> We know that Boston and Philadelphia are not connected by a direct flight, but we can’t tell whether or not there’s a sequence of flights that goes from Boston to Philadelphia. To help hunt for such a sequence, we draw a picture that includes all the flights. We make each city a point, and connect each pair of points that is connected by a direct flight.
