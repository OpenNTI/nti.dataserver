<p>A <span class="def">polygon</span> is a simple closed figure consisting entirely of line segments. By “closed figure,” we mean that if we trace the entire figure, our start point and end point are the same. By “simple,” we mean that the figure does not intersect itself. The line segments that form the boundaries of a polygon are the <a name="a0000010001" id="a0000010001"></a><a name="a0000010002" id="a0000010002"></a><span class="def">sides</span> of the polygon. Three polygons are shown on the left below. Three figures that are not polygons are shown on the right below. </p>

 The line segments that form the boundaries of a polygon are the <a name="a0000010006" id="a0000010006"></a><a name="a0000010007" id="a0000010007"></a><span class="def">sides</span> of the polygon. If we connect two vertices that are not adjacent on the polygon, we form a <a name="a0000010008" id="a0000010008"></a><span class="def">diagonal</span>, such as diagonal <span></span>
 in the diagram. </p><a name="a0000010009"></a>
<p>Each pair of consecutive sides of a polygon meet at a <a name="a0000010010" id="a0000010010"></a><a name="a0000010011" id="a0000010011"></a><span class="def">vertex</span> of the polygon. An <a name="a0000010012" id="a0000010012"></a><span class="def">interior angle</span> is an angle inside a polygon that is formed by a pair of consecutive sides of the polygon. </p><a name="a0000010013"></a>
<p>We often refer to polygons by their vertices, such as hexagon <span class="mathname">ABCDEF</span> above. When referring to a polygon by its vertices, we list the vertices in order going around the polygon. We can start with any vertex and go in either order around the polygon. So, we could refer to the polygon above as <span class="mathname">DCBAFE</span>, but we wouldn’t refer to it as <span class="mathname">ACFEDB</span>. </p><a name="a0000010014"></a>
<p>You’re already familiar with many polygons—triangles, squares, and rectangles are all polygons. We sometimes include the triangle symbol, <span></span>
, to make clear that we are referring to a triangle, not an angle. So, <span></span>
 refers to triangle <span class="mathname">ABC</span> while <span></span>
 refers to angle <span class="mathname">ABC</span>. </p><a name="a0000010015"></a>
<p>We have special names for some polygons based on the number of sides they have: <a name="a0000010016" id="a0000010016"></a><a name="a0000010017" id="a0000010017"></a><a name="a0000010018" id="a0000010018"></a> <a name="a0000010019" id="a0000010019"></a><a name="a0000010020" id="a0000010020"></a><a name="a0000010021" id="a0000010021"></a><a name="a0000010022" id="a0000010022"></a> </p>

<p> We start where we do with many word problems. We assign variables and try to make an equation using the information in the problem. Let <span class="mathname">x</span> be the measure of the initial angle. We know that the measure of this angle is twice the measure of another angle. So, this second angle must be half the first angle, which means the second angle has measure <span></span>
. Finally, the initial angle is <span></span>
 more than the third angle, which means the third angle has measure <span></span>
. Now, we can write an equation. The sum of the angles in any triangle is <span></span>

<p>No. The sum of the angles in a triangle is <span></span>

 in order for the three angles to add to <span></span>
. But we can’t have a <span></span>
 angle in a triangle! Similarly, if two angles were greater than <span></span>

<p>The angles of a triangle sum to <span></span>

<p>Suppose the third angle has measure <span class="mathname">x</span>. Since the sum of the measures of the first two angles is also <span class="mathname">x</span>, the sum of all three angles is <span></span>

<p>We don’t yet know how to find the sum of the interior angles in a polygon with 4 angles, but we do know how to find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with 3 angles. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is <span></span>

 is 2 times <span></span>

 You might be wondering what happens if one of the diagonals of a quadrilateral is <em>outside</em> the quadrilateral, as we see for quadrilateral <span class="mathname">WXYZ</span> at the right. We say that <span class="mathname">WXYZ</span> is a <span class="def">concave</span> quadrilateral because one of its diagonals is outside the quadrilateral. A quadrilateral in which both diagonals are inside the quadrilateral is called a <span class="def">convex</span> quadrilateral. Fortunately, diagonal <span></span>
 is inside <span class="mathname">WXYZ</span>, so we can still see that the interior angles of <span class="mathname">WXYZ</span> sum to <span></span>

 Just as some quadrilaterals are concave, so are some polygons with more than 4 sides. A <span class="def">concave</span> polygon is a polygon in which at least one of the diagonals is <em>outside</em> the polygon. For example, diagonal <span></span>
 is outside hexagon <span class="mathname">ABCDEF</span> at the left, so <span class="mathname">ABCDEF</span> is a concave polygon. A polygon in which all the diagonals are inside the polygon is called a <span class="def">convex</span> polygon.
