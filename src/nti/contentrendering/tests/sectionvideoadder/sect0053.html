<p>Percents are commonly used to describe an increase or decrease of some quantity. For example, you’ve probably seen ads for “20% off!” or read a news story about gas prices “rising 5%.” In these situations, we take a percent times the original quantity and add or subtract the result to get a new quantity. </p><a name="a0000008684"></a>
<p>For example, the quantity that is “a 30% increase from 400” is computed by first computing 30% of 400: </p>
<div id="a0000008686" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008687"></a>
<p> and then adding this increase to our original 400 to get <span></span>
. We could also compute this quantity by realizing that “a <span></span>
 increase from 400” means that we are adding 30% of 400 to our original 400. But our original 400 is 100% of 400, so after adding another 30% of 400 we will have a total of 130% of 100. Therefore, </p>

<p>First, we compute the amount of the increase or decrease. In this case, the quantity changed from 100 to 130, so it increased by 30. </p><a name="a0000008779"></a>
<p>Next, we write this increase as a percentage of the <em>original</em> quantity. We know that 30 is <span></span>
 of 100, so the change from 100 to 130 is a <span></span>
 increase. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000008780"></a>
<p>The amount of the increase is <span></span>

<div id="a0000008782" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008783"></a>
<p> Thus an increase from 60 to 210 is an increase of <span></span>

<p>The amount of the increase is <span></span>

<p>Note that <span></span>

<p>The calculation works the same way even if the quantities are fractions. The amount of the decrease from <span></span>

<p>Let’s look at a few word problems that might come up in everyday life. </p>
<div probnum="17" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000008807"></a>
<p>In 2009, Heart &amp; Sole Shoe Company sold 15 million pairs of shoes. In 2010, they increased advertising, and they sold 20% more shoes than in 2009. How many pairs of shoes did they sell in 2010? </p></div>
<div id="a0000008809" class="solution">Solution for Problem 17:</div>
<span><a name="a0000008810"></a>
<p> As usual with word problems, the first task is to convert the English words into a mathematical statement. In this problem it’s pretty straightforward: we are looking for the quantity that is <span></span>
 more than 15 million. The amount of the increase is </p>
<div id="a0000008812" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008813"></a>
<p> Therefore, the total sales for 2010 are equal to the sales for 2009 plus the amount of the increase, which gives us </p>
<div id="a0000008815" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008816"></a>
<p> pairs of shoes sold in 2010. </p></span>
<div probnum="18" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000008818"></a>
<p><a name="prob:computersale"></a> An iZest computer (made by Lemon Computer Co.) has a retail price of <span></span>
. Jim’s House of Electronics is having a “20%-off sale,” in which all items are discounted to <span></span>
 less than retail. Abigail also has a coupon for 30% off the sale price of any Lemon computer. How much does Abigail have to pay for a new iZest? </p></div>
<div id="a0000008820" class="solution">Solution for Problem 18:</div>
<span><a name="a0000008821"></a>
<p> Here’s a wrong solution—see if you can figure out the mistake: <div class="bogus"> The store has decreased the price by <span></span>
, and the coupon decreases the price by another <span></span>
. So the total decrease is <span></span>
 of the price, which is <span></span>
. Therefore, Abigail’s price is <span></span>
. </div> The problem is that percentage decreases don’t add as in the Bogus Solution above. That’s because the second decrease is taken from the new decreased price (after applying the first decrease), not the original price. This may not be clear, so let’s see how it works in this problem. We will apply the decreases one at a time. </p><a name="a0000008822"></a>
<p>First, the store decreases the price by <span></span>
. The amount of the decrease is <span></span>
, so the sale price offered by the store is <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000008823"></a>
<p>Next, Abigail applies her coupon that decreases the <em>new price</em> by <span></span>
. The amount of the decrease is <span></span>
, and thus the final price that Abigail pays is <span></span>
. </p></span><a name="a0000008824"></a>
<p>Let’s take another look at Problem <a href="sect0053.html#prob:computersale">18</a> and see another explanation for what’s going on, and why we can’t just add percentages. When the store has its 20%-off sale, it is decreasing the price of the computer by 20%. This means that the new sale price is <span></span>
 of the original price. <div class="important"> When a quantity is decreased by <span></span>
, then <span></span>
 of the quantity remains. </div> Thus, the price of the computer is now <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000008825"></a>
<p>Then, when Abigail uses her coupon, the <em>new price</em> is decreased by <span></span>
, so <span></span>
 of the new price remains. Thus, the final purchase price is <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000008826"></a>
<p>When we write both decreases together, we see that we end up <em>multiplying</em> percents: </p>
<div id="a0000008828" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008829"></a>
<p>Also notice that we finished up with <span></span>
 of the original retail price, so that total discount from the retail price to the final price was <span></span>
. Thus, a <span></span>
 decrease followed by a <span></span>
 decrease produces a total <span></span>
 decrease. A bit strange! We’ll ask you to explore this somewhat bizarre arithmetic further in a Challenge Problem. </p><a name="a0000008830"></a>

<div id="a0000008840" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008841"></a>
<p> Thus the population increased by <span></span>
 from 2005 to 2010. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000008842"></a>
<p>You might try the following “shortcut”: <div class="bogus"> In part (a), the population increased by <span></span>
. So in part (b), when we decrease by <span></span>
, we get back to where we started. Therefore the population in 2015 is the same as the population in 2005, which is <span></span>
. </div> Much like in Problem <a href="sect0053.html#prob:computersale">18</a>, this is not what actually happens. We will see what really happens when we do the computation. </p><a name="a0000008843"></a>
<p>We compute that <span></span>
 of the 2010 population is </p>
<div id="a0000008845" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008846"></a>
<p> So the population from 2010 to 2015 is projected to decrease by <span></span>
, and the 2015 population is projected to be </p>

<p>Again, perhaps this is a bit of a surprise! When the population increases by <span></span>
 from 2005 to 2010, and then decreases by <span></span>
 from 2010 to 2015, we don’t end up back where we started—instead, we end up with a <em>smaller</em> population. In fact, an increase by a percentage between <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, followed by a decrease by the same percentage, will always result in a smaller amount! <div class="warning"> Percent increases and decreases don’t “cancel each other out.” You need to compute each percent change separately. </div> You can explore this phenomenon more in Exercise 8.3.<a href="sect0053.html#exer:percentupdown">31</a>. </p>

<p><a name="prob:percentcompounded"></a> Wendy’s stock in GloboSuperOmni Corp is worth <span></span>
 at the start of January. In each month, the stock goes up <span></span>
 in value. What is the stock worth at the end of March? </p></div>
<div id="a0000008853" class="solution">Solution for Problem 20:</div>
<span><a name="a0000008854"></a>
<p> First, we’ll do this the long way, and then we’ll present a shortcut. </p><a name="a0000008855"></a>
<p><em>Method 1: Compute all the increases separately.</em> We have three <span></span>
 increases back-to-back-to-back. </p><a name="a0000008856"></a>
<p>The first is an increase of <span></span>
, so the value is <span></span>
 at the end of January. </p><a name="a0000008857"></a>
<p>The second is an increase of <span></span>
, so the value is <span></span>
 at the end of February. </p><a name="a0000008858"></a>
<p>The third is an increase of <span></span>
, so the value is <span></span>
 at the end of March. </p><a name="a0000008859"></a>
<p><em>Method 2: Compute all the increases at once.</em> Each <span></span>
 increase results in <span></span>
 of the quantity; thus, a <span></span>
 increase in a quantity is the same as multiplying the quantity by <span></span>
. Therefore, three successive increases of <span></span>
 is the same as multiplying the quantity three times by <span></span>
. This gives us </p>
<div id="a0000008861" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008862"></a>
<p> We can cube a percent just like we cube any other number: </p>
<div id="a0000008864" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008865"></a>
<p> So the final amount is </p>

<p>Problem <a href="sect0053.html#prob:percentcompounded">20</a> shows a little bit of the magic of <span class="def">compound interest</span>. Specifically, we determined in Problem <a href="sect0053.html#prob:percentcompounded">20</a> that after three consecutive <span></span>
 increases, an initial amount of <span></span>
 increases to <span></span>
. This is greater than if, instead of three separate <span></span>
 increases, we had done just a single <span></span>
 increase. A single increase of <span></span>
 would have been an increase of <span></span>
, giving a final amount of <span></span>
. So by taking three consecutive <span></span>
 increases instead of a single <span></span>
 increase, Wendy ends up with an extra <span></span>
 in her pocket. </p><a name="a0000008869"></a>
