<p>A <span class="def">point</span> is, well, a point. The great Greek mathematician Euclid called a point “that which has no part.” We can’t do much better than that vague description. We typically label points with capital letters. </p></li><li><a name="a0000010250"></a>
<p>A straight path connecting two points is called a <span class="def">segment</span>, and the original two points are the <span class="def">endpoints</span> of the segment. We refer to a segment by its endpoints, such as <span></span>
. We remove the bar to refer to the length of the segment: <span class="mathname">AB</span>. </p></li><li><a name="a0000010251"></a>
<p>If we start at a point, then head in one direction forever, we form a <span class="def">ray</span>. Our starting point is the <span class="def">vertex</span> of the ray, and we identify a ray as <span></span>
, where <span class="mathname">A</span> is the vertex of the ray and <span class="mathname">B</span> is some other point on the ray. </p></li><li><a name="a0000010252"></a>
<p>If we continue a line segment past its endpoints forever in both directions, we form a <span class="def">line</span>, which we write as <span></span>
. </p></li>

 Two rays that share an origin form an <span class="def">angle</span>. The common origin of the rays is the <span class="def">vertex</span> of the angle. We use the symbol <span></span>
 to refer to an angle, and we use a point on each side and the vertex to identify the angle, such as <span></span>
 at the right. We sometimes use just the vertex to identify the angle when it is clear what angle we mean. For example, we can write <span></span>
 to refer to the angle at the right. 
</div> </p><a name="a0000010254"></a>
<p>We can use a <span class="def">protractor</span> to measure angles (see page <a href="section-measureangle.html#pageprotractor">Figure</a>). The <span class="def">semicircular</span> arc of the protractor is divided into 180 degrees, so that a whole circle is 360 degrees. </p><a name="a0000010255"></a>

<p>An angle smaller than <span></span>
 is an <span class="def">acute angle</span>. </p></li><li><a name="a0000010257"></a>
<p>A <span></span>
 angle is a <span class="def">right angle</span>. Lines, segments, or rays that form a right angle are said to be <span class="def">perpendicular</span>. </p></li><li><a name="a0000010258"></a>
<p>An angle between <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 is an <span class="def">obtuse angle</span>. </p></li><li><a name="a0000010259"></a>
<p>An angle that measures <span></span>
 is a <span class="def">straight angle</span>. </p></li><li><a name="a0000010260"></a>
<p>An angle of more than <span></span>
 is a <span class="def">reflex angle</span>. </p></li>

<p>Two angles whose measures add to <span></span>
 are <span class="def">supplementary angles</span>. Angles that together make up a straight angle form a particularly useful example of supplementary angles. </p></li><li><a name="a0000010263"></a>
<p>Two angles whose measures add to <span></span>
 are <span class="def">complementary angles</span>. </p></li><li><a name="a0000010264"></a>
<p>Two angles that have the same measure are called <span class="def">congruent angles</span>. </p><a name="a0000010265"></a>

<p>When two lines intersect, they form two pairs of <span class="def">vertical angles</span>, such as <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 on the right. Vertical angles are congruent. </p></li>
</ul>  </div> </p><a name="a0000010267"></a>
<p><div class="defns"> Two lines that do not intersect are <span class="def">parallel</span>. A line that intersects multiple parallel lines is called a <span class="def">transversal line</span>. </div> </p><a name="a0000010268"></a>
<p><div class="important"><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_41.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 The angles formed when a transversal intersects two parallel lines come in two groups of four equal angles as shown: <div class="align-center"> <span></span>
</div>   Each of the first set of angles is supplementary to each of the second set of angles. </div> </p><a name="a0000010269"></a>
<p><div class="important"> The relationships described above when a transversal intersects two lines can also be used to show that two lines are parallel. </div> </p><a name="a0000010270"></a>

 A <span class="def">polygon</span> is a simple closed figure with line segments as boundaries. For example, all triangles are polygons. Several polygons are shown on the right. The line segments that form the boundaries of a polygon are the <span class="def">sides</span> of the polygon. Each pair of consecutive sides of a polygon meet at a <span class="def">vertex</span> of the polygon. Each angle inside a polygon formed by a pair of consecutive sides is called an <span class="def">interior angle</span> of the polygon. If we connect two vertices that are not adjacent on the polygon, we form a <span class="def">diagonal</span> of the polygon. </p><a name="a0000010271"></a>
<p><div class="important"> The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is <span></span>
, and the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with <span class="mathname">n</span> sides is <span></span>
 degrees. </div> </p><a name="a0000010272"></a>
<p><div class="defns"><a name="a0000010273"></a>
<p> Triangles can be classified by their angles. </p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li><a name="a0000010275"></a>
<p>A triangle with a right angle as an interior angle is a <span class="def">right triangle</span>. </p></li><li><a name="a0000010276"></a>
<p>A triangle with an obtuse angle as an interior angle is a <span class="def">obtuse triangle</span>. </p></li><li><a name="a0000010277"></a>
<p>A triangle in which all three angles are acute is an <span class="def">acute triangle</span>. </p></li>
</ul></div> </p><a name="a0000010278"></a>

 When we extend the sides of a triangle past the vertices, we form <span class="def">exterior angles</span> of the triangle. For example, the angles with measures <span class="mathname">x</span>, <span class="mathname">y</span>, and <span class="mathname">z</span> on the right are exterior angles of <span></span>
, while the angles with measures <span class="mathname">a</span>, <span class="mathname">b</span>, and <span class="mathname">c</span> are interior angles of the triangle. The sum of the exterior angles of any triangle is <span></span>
. </div> </p></div>
