<p>A ratio is used to compare the <em>relative</em> quantities of two or more groups or items. However, a ratio only compares the quantities to each other—it doesn’t tell us the actual values of the quantities. For example, suppose that you know that a certain history class has a ratio of girls to boys of <span></span>
. All this tells you is that for every 2 girls, there are 3 boys. It doesn’t tell you how many boys or girls there are. </p><a name="a0000008133"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> A ratio gives a <em>relative</em> comparison of two quantities. It doesn’t tell you anything about the total amount of the quantities. </div> </p><a name="a0000008134"></a>
<p><div class="defn"> To <span class="def">simplify</span> a ratio means to write it as a ratio of integers with no common factor greater than 1. </div> </p><a name="a0000008135"></a>
<p><div class="important"> Suppose we are using a ratio to compare two quantities that together make up a group (such as girls and boys in a class). If the two quantities are in the ratio <span></span>
, then the first quantity makes up <span></span>
 of the whole, and the second quantity makes up <span></span>
 of the whole. </div> </p><a name="a0000008136"></a>
<p>Whenever we have two ratios that are equal, we have a <span class="def">proportion</span>. The most common usage of proportion is when we have two changing quantities that are related in such a way that their ratio doesn’t change. </p><a name="a0000008137"></a>
<p>A commonly used ratio is <span class="def">speed</span>, which is the ratio of distance to time. We can write this as an equation as </p>
<div id="a0000008139" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008140"></a>
<p> This equation can be rearranged as </p>
<div id="a0000008142" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008143"></a>
<p> and also as </p>
<div id="a0000008145" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000008146"></a>
<p> The units associated with speed help us remember these equations. The word <span class="def">per</span> essentially means “divided by,” so a speed in miles per hour means to take distance (in miles) and divide by time (in hours). </p><a name="a0000008147"></a>
<p><div class="warning"> Speeds do not usually “average” in the way that you might expect them to. </div> </p><a name="a0000008148"></a>
<p>Speed is just a special example of a <span class="def">rate</span>. Whenever a quantity changes by a certain amount in a fixed unit of time, we have a rate. Just as with speed, the use of the word “per” is often a signal that we are working with a rate. Also, just as with speed, we can use the units to our advantage when solving problems. </p><a name="a0000008149"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> Pay close attention to units in word problems! Use the units in your mathematical expressions to help you figure out how to use the information in the problem. </div> </p><a name="a0000008150"></a>
<p>Unit conversions are just another type of rate. We can work with rates much like we work with conversion factors. In particular, we use them in mathematical expressions so that the units cancel in the way that we want. </p></div>
