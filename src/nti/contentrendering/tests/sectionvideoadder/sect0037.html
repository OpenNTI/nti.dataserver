<p>Our method of writing integers is based on powers of tens (probably because we have 10 fingers). It’s sometimes called the <a name="a0000006485" id="a0000006485"></a><span class="def">base 10</span> system. For example, the number 572 literally means “5 hundreds and 7 tens and 2 ones.” We can write this number in terms of powers of 10 as </p>
<div id="a0000006487" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006488"></a>
<p> Don’t forget that <span></span>
 for any number <span class="mathname">a</span>, so <span></span>
 is also a power of 10. </p><a name="a0000006489"></a>
<p>Decimals involve extending this “powers of 10” idea to non-integer numbers. We use a <span class="def">decimal point</span> to separate a number into a part that’s an integer and a part that’s between 0 and 1. For example, the number <span class="mathnumber">29.17</span> is equal to <span></span>
, where <span class="mathnumber">29</span> is a integer and <span class="mathnumber">0.17</span> is between 0 and 1. (The “0” in “<span class="mathnumber">0.17</span>” is not necessary—we could just write <span class="mathnumber">.17</span> without the zero—but including the 0 makes the number easier to read.) We read <span class="mathnumber">29.17</span> to mean “2 tens and 9 ones and 1 tenth and 7 hundredths,” where a tenth is <span></span>
 and a hundredth is <span></span>
. Since <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, we can also write <span class="mathnumber">29.17</span> in terms of powers of 10 as </p>

<p>You probably already know how to add these numbers (and may even be able to add them in your head!), but just to be clear let’s see exactly how this works. </p><a name="a0000006548"></a>
<p>We can write the two numbers that we’re adding in terms of powers of 10: </p>
<div id="a0000006550" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006551"></a>
<p> The commutative and associative properties of addition let us rearrange these products, so that the two products with <span></span>
 are together and the two products with <span></span>
 are together: </p>
<div id="a0000006553" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006554"></a>
<p> Now we factor: </p>
<div id="a0000006556" class="math equation">

<p> Writing this last quantity as a decimal, we see that <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000006558"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic parpic"><span></span>
</div> Of course, this is a lot of work for a fairly simple idea. The digits in the ones place (2 and 3) get added and their sum (5) is in the ones place of the sum. The digits in the tenths place (6 and 1) get added and their sum (7) is in the tenths place of the sum. But this is exactly what we do when we add integers: the digits in the ones place get added and their sum goes in the ones place, the digits in the tens place get added and their sum goes in the tens place, and so on. We’re just extending this idea—that digits in the same decimal place get added together—to the right of the decimal point. </p></li>
</ol><a name="a0000006559"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> When adding decimals, we add digits that are in the same decimal place. (Tens to tens, ones to ones, tenths to tenths, and so on.) </div> </p>
<ol class="parts itemize">

 </div>  <a name="a0000006561"></a>
<p>Ones digits get added to ones digits, tenths digits get added to tenths digits, hundredths digits get added to hundredths digits, and so on. There is a minor issue with the fact that <span class="mathnumber">13.9</span> doesn’t appear to have a hundredths digit, whereas <span class="mathnumber">2.37</span> does have a 7 as its hundredths digit. However, we know that <span></span>
, so in fact <span class="mathnumber">13.9</span> has an (unwritten) 0 as its hundredths digit. If we write that hidden 0, then we get the sum shown above at right. Notice how the decimal points are “lined up” in the sum. </p><a name="a0000006562"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic parpic"> <span></span>
 </div> Usually we don’t write unnecessary 0’s in the sum, as shown to the right. We have the (unwritten) 0 in the hundredths place of <span class="mathnumber">13.9</span> added to the 7 in the hundredths place of <span class="mathnumber">2.37</span> to give a 7 in the hundredths place of the sum. Also note that the 9 that’s the tenths digit in <span class="mathnumber">13.9</span> gets added to the 3 that’s the tenths digit in <span class="mathnumber">2.37</span>. This sums to 12 tenths, so we place a 2 in the tenths digit of the sum, and carry the extra 10 tenths over as a 1 in the ones digit (just like we carry when adding integers). Thus, the ones digit in our sum is <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000006563"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic parpic"> <span></span>
 </div> </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006564"></a>
<p>We add as shown to the right. Notice that the hidden 0’s in the hundredths and thousandths digits of <span class="mathnumber">0.4</span> are part of the addition. </p><a name="a0000006565"></a>
<p> <div class="important"> We often have to think about the extra hidden 0’s that are present in decimals, even if they are not written down. </div> </p><a name="a0000006566"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic parpic"> <span></span>
 </div> </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006567"></a>
<p>Here we see that the sum of the two decimals gives us <span class="mathnumber">.0</span> to the right of the decimal point, so that our sum is in fact an integer. We usually don’t write the <span class="mathnumber">.0</span> part in our final answer, and instead just write <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000006568"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic parpic"> <span></span>
 </div> </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006569"></a>
<p>Subtraction is essentially the same as addition. However, it is usually easier to explicitly write down the hidden 0’s that we need, because it makes the subtraction a bit easier to compute. In particular, the first step of our subtraction is to subtract the 7 in the hundredths digit of <span class="mathnumber">0.27</span> from the 0 in the hundredths digit of <span class="mathnumber">3</span>. As you know, this requires regrouping (or borrowing) a 10 from the 0 in the tenths digit of <span class="mathnumber">3</span>, and this in turn requires regrouping (or borrowing) a 10 from the 3 in the ones digit of <span class="mathnumber">3</span>. </p><a name="a0000006570"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic parpic"> <span></span>
 </div> </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006571"></a>
<p>The number that we are subtracting (<span class="mathnumber">0.280</span>) is larger than the number that we are subtracting from (<span class="mathnumber">0.135</span>), so the subtraction results in a negative decimal. Thus, just as with integers, we actually compute <span></span>
 and then take its negation to get our answer. This calculation is shown at right, and our answer is </p>
<div id="a0000006573" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006574"></a>
<p> Again, just like in part (e), writing the hidden 0 in the thousandths digit of <span class="mathnumber">0.28</span> makes the subtraction a bit easier to compute. </p></li>
</ol></span><a name="a0000006575"></a>
<p><a name="a0000006576" id="a0000006576"></a> <a name="a0000006577" id="a0000006577"></a> </p><a name="a0000006578"></a>

<p>Multiplying or dividing by a power of 10 is also pretty easy. We usually think of multiplying or dividing by a power of 10 as “moving the decimal point,” as we see in the following examples: </p>

<p>You may already know the quick way to compute this product. But in case you don’t, and to see why the quick way works, let’s first write the whole product in terms of powers of 10 (note that we’ll also write the 100 as a power of 10): </p>
<div id="a0000006594" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006595"></a>
<p> Now we use the distributive property to move the <span></span>
 term inside the large parentheses: </p>
<div id="a0000006597" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006598"></a>
<p> We then use the associative property on each product in the above sum to group the powers of 10 together: </p>
<div id="a0000006600" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006601"></a>
<p> Next, we use what we know about exponents to combine the powers of 10: </p>
<div id="a0000006603" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006604"></a>
<p> Finally, we write the right side of this last equation as a decimal number: </p>
<div id="a0000006606" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006607"></a>
<p>That’s a lot of work for a pretty simple computation. What’s essentially going on is that multiplying by <span></span>
 increases the exponent of each power of 10 by 2. But this means that each digit gets moved 2 positions to the left of where it starts. Specifically, the 2 that was originally in the units (<span></span>
) position gets moved to the hundreds (<span></span>
) position; the 5 that was originally in the tenths (<span></span>
 position gets moved to the tens (<span></span>
) position; and the 9 that was originally in the hundredths (<span></span>
) position gets moved to the units (<span></span>
) position. </p><a name="a0000006608"></a>
<p>We can also think of multiplying by <span></span>
 as “moving the decimal point 2 places to the right,” as follows: </p>
<div id="a0000006610" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006611"></a>
<p> <div class="concept"> Multiplying by <span></span>

<p>Again, let’s first be long-winded and perform the entire computation in terms of powers of 10. We know that <span></span>
, and we know that dividing by <span></span>
 is the same as multiplying by <span></span>
. That is, </p>
<div id="a0000006614" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006615"></a>
<p> Now we write <span class="mathnumber">36.7</span> in terms of powers of 10: </p>
<div id="a0000006617" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006618"></a>
<p> The distributive property lets us multiply each term of the sum by <span></span>
: </p>
<div id="a0000006620" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006621"></a>
<p> We can now use the associative property of multiplication to group the powers of 10 together: </p>
<div id="a0000006623" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006624"></a>
<p> Next, we combine the powers of 10: </p>
<div id="a0000006626" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006627"></a>
<p> Finally, we write our answer as a decimal, with a 3 as the hundredths digit (since it multiplies <span></span>
), a 6 as the thousandths digit (since it multiplies <span></span>
), and a 7 as the ten-thousandths digit (since it multiplies <span></span>
): </p>
<div id="a0000006629" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006630"></a>
<p> Notice the “extra” 0 that we have to write as the tenths digit of our answer. </p><a name="a0000006631"></a>
<p>When doing the above computation, we used the fact that dividing by a power of 10 is the same as multiplying by a power of 10. (In this example, dividing by <span></span>
 was the same as multiplying by <span></span>
.) So it makes sense that we can also think of division in terms of “moving the digits” or “moving the decimal point,” just like multiplication. Specifically, in this example, we are dividing by <span></span>
, so all digits get moved 3 positions to the right, which is the same as the decimal point getting moved 3 places to the left: </p>
<div id="a0000006633" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006634"></a>
<p> The decimal point that was immediately to the right of the 6 gets moved three places to the left. Notice that we need to add a 0 in front of the 3 in order to move the decimal point three places. Also, note that each digit ends up three positions to the right of where it started before the division. </p><a name="a0000006635"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> Dividing by <span></span>
 means moving each digit <span class="mathname">n</span> positions to the right. We can also think of this as moving the decimal point <span class="mathname">n</span> places to the left. </div> </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006636"></a>
<p>Multiplying by <span></span>
 moves the decimal point 3 places to the right (or, equivalently, moves all digits 3 positions to the left), so </p>
<div id="a0000006638" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006639"></a>
<p> This is sort of the opposite of part (b): we now have extra zeros that we don’t need, so we just write the answer as <span class="mathnumber">2.8</span>. </p></li>
</ol></span><a name="a0000006640"></a>
<p>Multiplication and division of decimals are a bit more complicated. We have to be especially careful about where the decimal point ends up in the result. </p>

<p>We can expand the decimal by powers of 10, and then use the distributive property: </p>
<div id="a0000006658" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006659"></a>
<p> This approach was pretty straightforward for this example, but this is not how we typically multiply decimals. A more typical process, which works better for harder examples, is: </p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li><a name="a0000006661"></a>
<p>Write each quantity as an integer times a power of 10, </p></li><li><a name="a0000006662"></a>
<p>Multiply the integers and the powers of 10 separately, and </p></li><li><a name="a0000006663"></a>
<p>Rewrite the product as a decimal. </p></li>
</ul><a name="a0000006664"></a>
<p> For example, we would compute <span></span>
 as </p>
<div id="a0000006666" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006667"></a>
<p> Normally, we wouldn’t go to so much trouble for a simple example, but this procedure will help with the more complicated examples that follow. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006668"></a>
<p>We use the procedure described in part (a) above: </p>
<div id="a0000006670" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006671"></a>
<p> As a check, note that our multiplication is taking the number 1.3 and nearly tripling it (since 2.9 is just a bit less than 3). So we expect our answer to be slightly less than 3.9, and indeed 3.77 fits the bill. This gives us reassurance that the decimal point is in the correct spot. <div class="concept"> If possible, perform a quick check at the end of a computation, to see if your answer is reasonable. </div> </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006672"></a>
<p>Here we know that the answer will have the digit 6 (since <span></span>
); the only issue is where the decimal point is located. Explicitly writing the powers of 10 makes it less likely that you’ll make a mistake: </p>
<div id="a0000006674" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006675"></a>
<p>Alternatively, you can also think of the computation as </p>
<div id="a0000006677" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006678"></a>
<p> We compute <span></span>
. Then, multiplying by the first factor of <span class="mathnumber">0.001</span> moves the decimal point 3 places to the left, and multiplying by the second factor of <span class="mathnumber">0.001</span> moves the decimal point another 3 places to the left. So our answer is 6 with the decimal point moved a total of <span></span>
 places to the left, which is <span class="mathnumber">0.000006</span>. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006679"></a>
<p>We have </p>
<div id="a0000006681" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006682"></a>
<p>We could also compute this product as </p>
<div id="a0000006684" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006685"></a>
<p> We compute <span></span>
, then move the decimal point to the left a total of <span></span>
 places (2 places for each factor of <span class="mathnumber">0.01</span>). Thus the answer is <span class="mathnumber">0.0165</span>. </p><a name="a0000006686"></a>
<p>As a check, note that both original numbers (<span class="mathnumber">0.11</span> and <span class="mathnumber">0.15</span>) are between <span class="mathnumber">0.1</span> and <span class="mathnumber">0.2</span>, so our product should be between <span></span>
 and <span></span>
. The answer <span class="mathnumber">0.0165</span> is indeed between <span class="mathnumber">0.01</span> and <span class="mathnumber">0.04</span>, so we can be confident the decimal point is in the correct place. </p><a name="a0000006687"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> There are many processes for multiplying decimals. Use the method that works best for you for any particular problem. The most common mistake when multiplying decimals is placing the decimal point in an incorrect location in the product. Whenever it’s reasonably possible, double-check your answer to be sure that you have correctly placed the decimal point. </div> </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006688"></a>
<p>We can use a similar process with division: we write each number as an integer times a power of 10, and then group the integers together and the powers of 10 together. In this problem, we have </p>
<div id="a0000006690" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006691"></a>
<p> We could also write the division as a fraction, and multiply by a suitable power of 10 to make both numerator and denominator an integer. Using this method, our computation is: </p>
<div id="a0000006693" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006694"></a>
<p>This is almost the same as part (e), but the number that we are dividing by in this part is 10 times the number we are dividing by in part (e). So since we are now dividing by a number that is 10 times as large, our answer to this part should be our answer from part (e) divided by 10, or <span></span>
. We can check this by computing using powers of 10: </p>
<div id="a0000006696" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006697"></a>
<p> As a computation using fractions, this is </p>
<div id="a0000006699" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006700"></a>
<p>We can write this directly as a power of 10: </p>
<div id="a0000006702" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006703"></a>
<p> Alternatively, we might recognize that <span class="mathnumber">0.001</span> is 10 times <span class="mathnumber">0.0001</span>, since moving the decimal point in 0.0001 one place to the right gives 0.001. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006704"></a>
<p>Using fractions we have </p>
<div id="a0000006706" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006707"></a>
<p> A simpler solution is to recognize that <span></span>

<span><a name="a0000006717"></a>
<p> All the numbers in the list are between 0 and 1, so we start comparing them by looking at the first digit after the decimal point. We can group the numbers by their tenths digits: all those with tenths digit 6 are larger than all those with tenths digit 5, which are all larger than all those with tenths digit 0: </p>
<div id="a0000006719" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006720"></a>
<p> Within each group, we then compare hundredths digits. We have to keep in mind that if a hundredths digit is not present, then it is 0. For example, <span></span>
, because they have equal tenths digits, and the hundredths digit of <span class="mathnumber">0.65</span> (which is 5) is greater than the hundredths digit of <span class="mathnumber">0.6</span> (which is 0). If the numbers agree in both the tenths digit and the hundredths digit (like <span class="mathnumber">0.55</span> and <span class="mathnumber">0.555</span>), we then look at the thousandths digit (so that <span></span>
). In the end, the numbers get arranged as </p>
<div id="a0000006722" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006723"></a>
<p>Another way to approach this problem is to write some of the hidden zeros in the decimals, so that all the decimals are the same length. That is, we rewrite our original list as </p>
<div id="a0000006725" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006726"></a>
