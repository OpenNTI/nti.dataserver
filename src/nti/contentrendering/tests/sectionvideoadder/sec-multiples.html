<p>We know that <span class="mathnumber">12</span> equals <span class="mathnumber">3</span> times <span class="mathnumber">4</span>. In other words, <span class="mathnumber">12</span> equals some integer times <span class="mathnumber">4</span>. For that reason, we say that <span class="mathnumber">12</span> is a <span></span>
 of 4. </p><a name="a0000002573"></a>
<p><div class="defn"> Let <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span> be numbers. We say that <span class="mathname">a</span> is a <span class="def">multiple</span> of <span class="mathname">b</span> if <span class="mathname">a</span> equals <span class="mathname">b</span> times some integer. In other words, <span class="mathname">a</span> is a multiple of <span class="mathname">b</span> if there is an integer <span class="mathname">n</span> such that <span></span>

<p>For instance, 7 is <em>not</em> a multiple of 4, because we cannot write 7 as the product of 4 and an integer. Note that <span class="mathnumber">-12</span> is a multiple of <span class="mathnumber">4</span>, because <span class="mathnumber">-12</span> equals <span class="mathnumber">-3</span> times <span class="mathnumber">4</span>. Similarly, <span class="mathnumber">0</span> is a multiple of <span class="mathnumber">4</span>, because <span class="mathnumber">0</span> equals <span class="mathnumber">0</span> times <span class="mathnumber">4</span>. </p><a name="a0000002575"></a>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll talk about division differently than we did in Chapter <a href="chapter-arithmetic.html">1</a>. We’ll use the “quotient and remainder” concept of division, which you probably used when you first learned about division. As an example, when we divide 13 by 4, the quotient is 3 and the remainder is 1. </p><a name="a0000002576"></a>
<p>Using this view of division, we can say that an integer <span class="mathname">a</span> is a multiple of an integer <span class="mathname">b</span> if <span class="mathname">a</span> divided by <span class="mathname">b</span> has remainder 0. So, for example, 12 is a multiple of 4 because <span class="mathnumber">12</span> divided by <span class="mathnumber">4</span> has remainder 0, while 13 is not a multiple of 4 because <span class="mathnumber">13</span> divided by <span class="mathnumber">4</span> has remainder 1. </p><div id="a0000002577" class="section-problems"><span class="headingtext">Section Problems</span></div>

<div id="a0000002600" class="solution">Solution for Problem 1:</div>
<span>
<ol class="parts itemize">
	<li class="part"><a name="a0000002602"></a>
<p>We have <span></span>
 and <span></span>
. We can add these two using the distributive property: </p>
<div id="a0000002604" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000002605"></a>
<p> So, <span></span>
 can be written as 7 times an integer, which means that <span></span>
 is a multiple of 7. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000002606"></a>
<p>Because <span class="mathname">k</span> is a multiple of 7, there is an integer <span class="mathname">a</span> for which <span></span>
. So, adding 7 to <span class="mathname">k</span> gives <span></span>
. We can then factor out 7 to write </p>
<div id="a0000002608" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000002609"></a>
<p> Since <span class="mathname">a</span> is an integer, so is <span></span>
. Therefore, we can write <span></span>
 as 7 times some integer, which means that <span></span>
 is indeed a multiple of 7. Moreover, our work above tells us that adding 7 to a multiple of 7 produces the next multiple of 7. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000002610"></a>
<p>We can use our solution to part (b) of as a guide. Because <span class="mathname">r</span> is a multiple of 7, there is an integer <span class="mathname">m</span> such that <span></span>
. Similarly, because <span class="mathname">s</span> is a multiple of <span class="mathnumber">7</span>, there is an integer <span class="mathname">n</span> such that <span></span>
. We then have <span></span>
, and factoring out 7 gives </p>
<div id="a0000002612" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000002613"></a>
<p> Because <span class="mathname">m</span> and <span class="mathname">n</span> are integers, <span></span>
 is an integer. So the equation <span></span>
 says that <span></span>
 is <span class="mathnumber">7</span> times some integer. In other words, <span></span>
 is a multiple of <span class="mathnumber">7</span>. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000002614"></a>
<p>Part (c) tells us that the sum of any two multiples of 7 is a multiple of 7. So, if <span class="mathname">k</span> is a multiple of 7, then <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 are both multiples of 7. Moreover, because <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 are 7 apart, they are consecutive multiples of 7. So, there are no multiples of <span class="mathnumber">7</span> between <span></span>
 and <span></span>
. Specifically, <span></span>
 is not a multiple of 7. </p><a name="a0000002615"></a>
<p>We might also have thought about division to see why <span></span>
 is not a multiple of 7. Since <span></span>
 is a multiple of 7 and <span></span>
 is 2 greater than <span></span>
, we know that <span></span>
 divided by 7 has a remainder of 2. So, <span></span>
 is not a multiple of 7. </p></li>
</ol></span><a name="a0000002616"></a>
<p>Part (b) of Problem <a href="sec-multiples.html#prob:intromult7pr">4</a> tells us that if we start at any multiple of 7 and count by 7’s, we’ll generate multiples of 7 from our starting point onward. Similarly, we can also generate multiples of 7 by starting from some multiple of 7 and subtracting 7 over and over. For example, the following are all multiples of 7: </p>
<div id="a0000002618" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000002619"></a>
<p><div class="important"> If we start from any multiple of <span class="mathname">n</span> and count either upward or downward by <span class="mathname">n</span>’s, all the numbers we hit will be multiples of <span class="mathname">n</span>.<a name="howtofindmults"></a> </div> </p><a name="a0000002620"></a>
<p>Part (c) of Problem <a href="sec-multiples.html#prob:intromult7pr">4</a> is an example of a neat property of multiples. If we add two multiples of a number, we get another multiple of the same number. Similarly, the difference between any two multiples of a number is another multiple of that same number. </p><a name="a0000002621"></a>
<p><div class="important"> If <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span> are multiples of <span class="mathname">c</span>, then both <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 are multiples of <span class="mathname">c</span>. </div> </p><a name="a0000002622"></a>
<p>Finally, part (d) of Problem <a href="sec-multiples.html#prob:intromult7pr">4</a> is an example of why we know that we don’t skip any multiples of 7 when we count by 7’s starting from a multiple of 7. We can go through basically the same steps to see that if we add a multiple of 7 and a number that is not a multiple of 7, then the resulting sum is not a multiple of 7. </p><a name="a0000002623"></a>
<p><div class="important"> If we start with a multiple of <span class="mathname">n</span> and add (or subtract) a number that is not a multiple of <span class="mathname">n</span>, then the resulting sum (or difference) is not a multiple of <span class="mathname">n</span>.<a name="addnonmultddd"></a> </div> </p>
<div probnum="2" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000002625"></a>
<p>What number between <span class="mathnumber">100</span> and <span class="mathnumber">200</span> is both a perfect square and a multiple of <span class="mathnumber">7</span>? <span class="source">(Source: MOEMS)</span></p></div><a name="a0000002626"></a>
<p><div class="warning"> In this book, when we say “between <span class="mathnumber">100</span> and <span class="mathnumber">200</span>,” we don’t include <span class="mathnumber">100</span> and <span class="mathnumber">200</span>. </div> </p>
<div id="a0000002628" class="solution">Solution for Problem 2:</div>
<span><a name="a0000002629"></a>
<p> The perfect squares between 100 and 200 are 121, 144, 169, and 196. When we divide each of these squares by 7, we find that only 196 is a multiple of 7. To be specific, 196 is 28 times 7. So the answer is 196. </p><a name="a0000002630"></a>
<p>Here’s another way to see that <span class="mathnumber">196</span> is a multiple of <span class="mathnumber">7</span>. Note that <span class="mathnumber">196</span> is <span class="mathnumber">14</span> times <span class="mathnumber">14</span>, and <span class="mathnumber">14</span> is a multiple of <span class="mathnumber">7</span>. Specifically, we have <span></span>
, so <span></span>
. Therefore, 196 is a multiple of 7. </p></span>

<p>What is the greatest three-digit number that is a multiple of 13? <span class="source">(Source: MATHCOUNTS)</span></p></div>
<div id="a0000002634" class="solution">Solution for Problem 3:</div>
<span><a name="a0000002635"></a>
<p> The three-digit numbers are the integers from 100 to 999. We are looking for the <em>greatest</em> such integer that is a multiple of 13. So let’s divide 999 by 13. We get a quotient of 76 and a remainder of 11. In other words, 999 is 11 more than a multiple of 13. So the multiple of <span class="mathnumber">13</span> we want is <span></span>
, which is <span class="mathnumber">988</span>. </p><a name="a0000002636"></a>
<p>We also can solve this problem using our insights about multiples from Problem <a href="sec-multiples.html#prob:intromult7pr">4</a>. We find a multiple of 13 near 1000, and then add or subtract multiples of 13 to find the largest three-digit multiple of 13. For example, we know that 1300 and 130 are multiples of 13, so <span></span>
 is a multiple of 13, as is <span></span>
. Therefore, <span></span>
 is a multiple of 13, which means that the largest multiple of 13 less than 1000 is <span></span>
. </p></span><a name="a0000002637"></a>
