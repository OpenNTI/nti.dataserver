</div>

<a name="a0000007415"></a>
<p><a name="a0000007416" id="a0000007416"></a> <a name="a0000007417" id="a0000007417"></a> </p><a name="a0000007418"></a>
<p>A <span class="def">ratio</span> is used to compare the <em>relative</em> quantities of (usually) two groups or items of data. </p><a name="a0000007419"></a>
<p>A simple example should give you an idea of what we mean. Suppose a certain science class has 10 girls and 7 boys. We would say that the <span class="def">ratio</span> of girls to boys in the class is 10 to 7. We can write this in a few different ways: </p>
<div id="a0000007421" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007422"></a>
<p> The notation <span></span>
 is the most commonly used when writing, and is usually spoken “10 to 7.” </p><a name="a0000007423"></a>
<p>The key concept to remember is that the ratio only compares the two quantities—it doesn’t tell us anything about the amount of the quantities. For example, suppose that you know that in a history class, the ratio of girls to boys of <span></span>
. All this tells you is that for every 2 girls, there are 3 boys. There might be 2 girls and 3 boys in the class, or there might be 10 girls and 15 boys in the class, or there might be 200 girls and 300 boys in the class (in a very large classroom!). All you know is that if there are <span></span>
 girls, then there are <span></span>
 boys, but you don’t know what <span class="mathname">n</span> is. </p><a name="a0000007424"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> A ratio gives a <em>relative</em> comparison of two quantities. It doesn’t tell you anything about the total amount of the quantities. </div> </p><a name="a0000007425"></a>
<p>Ratios behave a lot like fractions. They are usually written in <a name="a0000007426" id="a0000007426"></a><a name="a0000007427" id="a0000007427"></a><span class="def">simplest form</span> as a ratio of two positive integers with no common factor larger than 1. To change our example, suppose that we’re now considering a math class with 12 girls and 6 boys. We could write that the ratio of girls to boys is 12 to 6 or <span></span>
. However, we could also divide the students into 6 identical groups, where each group has 2 girls and 1 boy. This means that the ratio of girls to boys is <span></span>
 in each group, but since all the groups are the same, the overall ratio of girls to boys is also <span></span>
. We therefore have <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000007428"></a>
<p>We typically reduce to simplest form by dividing the greatest common factor from each part of the ratio. So to continue our example, since the greatest common factor of 12 and 6 is 6, the ratio of girls to boys is <span></span>
 to <span></span>
, or 2 to 1. This also makes sense if we use fraction notation: </p>
<div id="a0000007430" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007431"></a>
<p> In words this means that for every 2 girls there is 1 boy. This process of reducing the ratio to simplest form is also called <span class="def">simplifying</span> the ratio. </p><a name="a0000007432"></a>

<p>The greatest common factor of 2 and 10 is 2. So, we divide both parts of the ratio by 2, and we get </p>
<div id="a0000007461" class="math equation">
<div></div>

<p> Therefore the simplified ratio is <span></span>

<p>The greatest common factor of 9 and 6 is 3, so we divide both parts of the ratio by 3, and we get </p>

<p>To write <span></span>
 as a ratio of positive integers, we need to multiply both parts of the ratio by some number that will cancel both denominators. The number we need is the least common multiple of the two denominators, which is 6. This gives us </p>

<p> This is a ratio of two positive integers with no common factor (other than 1), so we’re done. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000007480"></a>

<p><a name="prob:ratiocatsdogs"></a> The ratio of cats to dogs in a pet shop is <span></span>
. If there are 25 dogs in the shop, then how many cats are there? </p></div>
<div id="a0000007489" class="solution">Solution for Problem 2:</div>
<span><a name="a0000007490"></a>
<p> The ratio <span></span>
 means that for every 2 cats, there are 5 dogs. Naturally, this also means that for every 5 dogs, there are 2 cats. The latter way of thinking about this ratio seems more useful, since we are told how many dogs there are and we want to figure out how many cats there are. </p><a name="a0000007491"></a>
<p>There are 25 dogs in the shop. We can think of this as 5 groups of 5 dogs each. Each group of 5 dogs has a corresponding group of 2 cats. So in the shop, there are 5 groups of 2 cats each, for a total of <span></span>
 cats. </p><a name="a0000007492"></a>
<p>Another way to think about this problem is to let <span class="mathname">c</span> be the number of cats in the shop. <div class="concept"> It often helps to assign a variable to an unknown quantity. Also, pick your variable names to help you remember what they represent, like <span class="mathname">c</span> for “cats.” </div> Since the ratio of cats to dogs in the shop is <span></span>
, we have the equation </p>
<div id="a0000007494" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007495"></a>
<p> We can make the second ratio look like the first one by multiplying the parts of the second ratio by 5, giving </p>
<div id="a0000007497" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007498"></a>
<p> Comparing the first and last ratios above tells us that <span></span>
, so there are 10 cats in the shop. Indeed, we can check that <span></span>
. </p></span><a name="a0000007499"></a>
<p>Setting two ratios equal, such as <span></span>
 in Problem <a href="sect0043.html#prob:ratiocatsdogs">2</a>, is an example of a <span class="def">proportion</span>. We will cover proportions in more detail in Section <a href="sec-proportions.html">7.3</a>. </p>
<div probnum="3" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000007501"></a>
<p><a name="prob:ratiogirlsboys"></a> Mrs. Miller’s class has a ratio of girls to boys of <span></span>

<div id="a0000007503" class="solution">Solution for Problem 3:</div>
<span><a name="a0000007504"></a>
<p> At first, it seems like we may not have enough information to solve this problem—the ratio tells us a relationship between girls and boys, but we’re not given the number of girls or the number of boys. Instead, we’re just told the total number of students. </p><a name="a0000007505"></a>
<p>However, we can use the given ratio to construct a new ratio: the ratio of girls to the total number of students. We know that the <span></span>
 girls-to-boys ratio means that for every 4 girls, there are 3 boys. So this means that for every 4 girls, there are <span></span>
 <em>total</em> students (girls and boys), and thus the ratio of girls to all students is <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000007506"></a>
<p>Let <span class="mathname">g</span> be the number of girls in the class. Since there are 35 students in the class, we have </p>
<div id="a0000007508" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007509"></a>
<p> Multiplying the parts of the first ratio by 5 gives </p>
<div id="a0000007511" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007512"></a>
<p> so <span></span>
 and there are 20 girls. </p><a name="a0000007513"></a>
<p>Another way to think of this is that girls make up <span></span>
 of the total number of students, and boys make up <span></span>
 of the total number of students. As a check, notice that <span></span>
, so girls and boys together make up all of the students. </p></span><a name="a0000007514"></a>
<p><div class="important"> Suppose we are using a ratio to compare two quantities that together make up a group (such as girls and boys in a class). If the two quantities are in the ratio <span></span>

 of the whole. </div> </p><a name="a0000007515"></a>

<p> When we cut the rope, it will consist of two pieces that together make up the whole rope. Since the pieces have lengths in ratio <span></span>

<p>My aunt’s candy jar has 56 pieces of candy. She only has butterscotch and jelly beans, and the ratio of butterscotch to jelly beans is <span></span>
. I like jelly beans more, and I want to add some jelly beans so that the ratio of butterscotch to jelly beans is <span></span>
. How many jelly beans should I add? </p></div>
<div id="a0000007526" class="solution">Solution for Problem 5:</div>
<span><a name="a0000007527"></a>
<p> We start by figuring out how many pieces of each type of candy are in the jar. For practice, we’ll show the two main methods. </p><a name="a0000007528"></a>
<p><em>Method 1: Use a variable.</em> Since the ratio of butterscotch to jelly beans is <span></span>
, we know that there are <span></span>
 pieces of butterscotch and <span></span>
 jelly beans for some <span class="mathname">n</span>. We also know that there are 56 pieces total. So <span></span>
, which means <span></span>
. Dividing by 7 gives us <span></span>
, so there are <span></span>
 pieces of butterscotch and <span></span>
 jelly beans in the jar. </p><a name="a0000007529"></a>
<p><em>Method 2: Parts of the whole.</em> The butterscotch and the jelly beans are the only candies in the jar, and they have ratio <span></span>
. Therefore, we know that butterscotch makes up <span></span>
 of the total candy and that jelly beans make up <span></span>
 of the total candy. Thus, since there are 56 pieces total, there are <span></span>
 pieces of butterscotch and <span></span>
 jelly beans. </p><a name="a0000007530"></a>
<p>Next, we want the final ratio of butterscotch to jelly beans to be <span></span>
. There are 40 pieces of butterscotch, and that won’t change after we add jelly beans, so we want the new total amount <span class="mathname">j</span> of jelly beans to be such that <span></span>
. You can probably see right away that we must have <span></span>
, but if not, we can always compute it by multiplying both parts of the <span></span>
 ratio by 20 so that the first part of the ratio equals 40, like this: </p>
<div id="a0000007532" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007533"></a>
<p> This must equal <span></span>
, so we must have <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000007534"></a>
<p>We conclude that I want the jar to have 20 jelly beans. It starts with 16 jelly beans, so I need to add <span></span>
 jelly beans to the jar. </p></span><div id="a0000007535" class="exercises"><span class="headingtext">Exercises</span></div>
