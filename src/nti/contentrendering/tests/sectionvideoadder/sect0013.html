<p>Every positive integer is divisible by 1 and by itself. Some numbers are not divisible by any other positive integers. For example, 5 is divisible by 1 and 5, but not by any other positive integer. Meanwhile, 6 is divisible by 1 and 6, but also by 2 and 3. </p><a name="a0000002895"></a>
<p><div class="defn"> A <span class="def">prime number</span> is a positive integer that is divisible by exactly two positive integers: 1 and the number itself. A <span class="def">composite number</span> is a positive integer that is divisible by more than two positive integers. This means that a number is composite if it is divisible by some positive integer besides 1 and the number itself. </div> </p><a name="a0000002896"></a>
<p>For example, 2 is divisible by 1 and by 2, but it is not divisible by any other positive number. Therefore, 2 is prime. Meanwhile, 12 is divisible by 3, so 12 is composite.

<p> In the introduction, we noted that 1 is not prime and 2 is prime. </p><a name="a0000002929"></a>
<p>The number 3 is divisible by 1 and by 3, but not by 2. A positive number cannot be divisible by a number greater than itself, so we don’t have to check if 3 is divisible by 4 or 5 or any other number greater than 3. Therefore, we know that 3 is prime. </p><a name="a0000002930"></a>
<p>Since 4 is divisible by 2, we know that 4 is composite. Similarly, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 are all divisible by 2 and therefore are composite. Of course, you probably recognize these as even numbers. Any number that is divisible by 2 is even, and any integer that is not divisible by 2 is an odd number. Since every even number is divisible by 2, the only even prime is 2. So, we don’t have to check any more even numbers. </p><a name="a0000002931"></a>
<p>Continuing in this manner, we find that the only primes less than 20 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. To see why the other numbers are not prime, we note that 1 is not prime by definition, all the other even numbers are divisible by 2, and both 9 and 15 are multiples of 3. </p></span><a name="a0000002932"></a>

<p>Yes, she is right. Every multiple of 4 is also a multiple of 2, since 4 is a multiple of 2. But Meena already knows that 113 is not a multiple of 2, so she knows that 113 cannot possibly be a multiple of 4. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000002947"></a>
<p>The last digit of 113 is not 0 or 5, so she knows that 113 is not divisible by 5. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000002948"></a>
<p>Yes, she is right. As in part (a), every multiple of 6 is also a multiple of 2, since 6 is a multiple of 2. Meena knows that 113 is not a multiple of 2, so she knows that 113 cannot be a multiple of 6. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000002949"></a>
<p>She doesn’t have to test 8 or 10 because these are both multiples of 2. Since 113 is not a multiple of 2, Meena knows that 113 is not divisible by any even number. </p><a name="a0000002950"></a>
<p>Every multiple of 9 is also a multiple of 3. Since Meena knows that 113 is not a multiple of 3, she knows that 113 cannot be a multiple of 9, either. Therefore, Meena doesn’t have to test 8, 9, or 10. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000002951"></a>
<p>Meena knows that 113 is not a multiple of any integer from 2 through 10. So, if 113 is the product of two integers, and neither integer is 1, then both of the integers must be greater than 10. </p><a name="a0000002952"></a>
<p>The smallest possible product of two integers greater than 10 is <span></span>
, which is larger than 113. Any other product of two integers greater than 10 will be even larger. So, 113 cannot be written as the product of two integers that are greater than 1. This means that 113 is divisible only by 1 and by itself, so 113 is prime. </p></li>

<p>Our work in Problem <a href="sect0013.html#prob:findprime">5</a> revealed two very important points about testing whether or not a number is prime. </p><a name="a0000002954"></a>
<p><div class="important"> If a number is not divisible by a prime, then it is not divisible by any multiple of that prime. So, in testing whether or not a number is prime, we only need to test if that number is divisible by prime numbers. </div> </p><a name="a0000002955"></a>
<p><div class="important"> To check if a number is prime, we only need to test if it is divisible by primes whose squares are less than or equal to the number we are testing. </div> </p><a name="a0000002956"></a>
<p>For example, to test whether or not 59 is prime, we only need to check if it is divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. Since <span></span>
 is greater than 59, we don’t need to test any other primes. </p>

<div id="a0000002992" class="solution">Solution for Problem 19:</div>
<span><a name="a0000002993"></a>
<p> The smallest number in the grid is 2, so we start by circling 2 in Step 1. Step 2 then tells us to cross out all of the multiples of 2 except for 2, so we cross out all the even numbers except 2. Moving on to Step 3, we still have plenty of numbers that are not circled or crossed out, so we go back to Step 1.  </p><a name="a0000002994"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{num_thy_3.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 The smallest number that was not circled or crossed out already is 3, so we circle 3. We then cross out all the other multiples of 3. As we go, we notice that a bunch of these multiples of 3 are already crossed out—these are the numbers that are also multiples of 2. After crossing out all the multiples of 3 besides 3, we still have many numbers that are not circled or crossed out. Back to Step 1 we go.  </p><a name="a0000002995"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{num_thy_4.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 Now the smallest number that was not circled or crossed out already is 5, so we circle 5. We then cross out all of the other multiples of 5. There are still plenty of numbers to go. Back to Step 1.  </p><a name="a0000002996"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{num_thy_5.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 The smallest number that was not circled or crossed out is now 7, so we circle that and then cross out the other multiples of 7. Sigh, still a bunch of numbers to go. </p><a name="a0000002997"></a>
<p>The next number we’ll circle is 11. But there are no other multiples of 11 in the grid that are not circled or crossed out. This is because we have circled or crossed out all the multiples of 2, 3, 5, and 7 already. That means we have crossed out <span></span>
, <span></span>
, <span></span>
, and <span></span>
. We also crossed out <span></span>
, <span></span>
, and <span></span>
 when we crossed out multiples of 2, and we crossed out <span></span>
 when we crossed out multiples of 3.  </p><a name="a0000002998"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{num_thy_6.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 We circle 11 and still have plenty of numbers left. But for each number we circle, there are no more un-crossed-out multiples of the circled number left in the grid. So, as we repeat the three steps over and over, we circle all the remaining numbers in the grid. In the end, we have the grid at the right. </p><a name="a0000002999"></a>
<p>The circled numbers are the primes less than 100! Why? </p><a name="a0000003000"></a>
<p>Each time we cross out numbers in Step 2, the numbers we cross out are multiples of the number we just circled in Step 1. So, all of the crossed out numbers are composite. We’ll never cross out a prime number, because a prime number isn’t a multiple of any of the numbers in the grid besides itself. Therefore, eventually each prime number will become the smallest available number in the grid in Step 1. It will then be circled and all its multiples crossed out. Since each prime gets circled and all its multiples get crossed out, every composite number will get crossed out in the step after we circle the smallest prime that evenly divides the composite number. So, we must have all primes in the grid circled and all composite numbers crossed out when we finish. </p><a name="a0000003001"></a>
<p>This process is called the <a name="a0000003002" id="a0000003002"></a><span class="def">Sieve of Eratosthenes</span> after the ancient Greek mathematician who developed it.
