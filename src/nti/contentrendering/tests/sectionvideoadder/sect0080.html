<p>We’ll start with the simplest counting task: counting lists of numbers. Some lists of numbers<a name="a0000012086" id="a0000012086"></a> are really easy to count. </p>
<div probnum="1" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000012088"></a>
<p><a name="prob:easycount"></a> How many numbers are in the list </p>
<div id="a0000012090" class="math equation">

</div></div>
<div id="a0000012092" class="solution">Solution for Problem 1:</div>
<span><a name="a0000012093"></a>
<p> Obviously, there are 16 numbers. </p></span><a name="a0000012094"></a>
<p>That was pretty easy. The counting was already done for us! Many other counting problems can be reduced to this type of counting. </p>
<div probnum="2" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000012096"></a>
<p><a name="prob:9to27"></a> How many numbers are in the list </p>
<div id="a0000012098" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012099"></a>
<p> We could also ask this problem as “How many numbers are there between 9 and 27 inclusive?” (<span class="def">Inclusive</span><a name="a0000012100" id="a0000012100"></a> means that we include the 9 and the 27 in our count.) </p></div>
<div id="a0000012102" class="solution">Solution for Problem 2:</div>
<span><a name="a0000012103"></a>
<p> We could just count them from left to right and find that there are 19 numbers. However, a more clever way to approach this problem is to convert this problem into a problem like Problem <a href="sect0080.html#prob:easycount">1</a>, by subtracting 8 from every number in our list: </p>
<div id="a0000012105" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012106"></a>
<p> We know how to count the new list! There are 19 items in the list. So, there are 19 items in our original list. </p></span><a name="a0000012107"></a>
<p>Problem <a href="sect0080.html#prob:9to27">2</a> illustrates a very important problem-solving idea. </p><a name="a0000012108"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> When presented with a complicated problem, try to turn it into a simpler problem that you know how to solve. </div> </p><a name="a0000012109"></a>
<p>You may also notice that in Problem <a href="sect0080.html#prob:9to27">2</a>, if we subtract the ending and starting numbers of our list, then we get <span></span>
. This is one fewer than the number of items (19) in the list. Perhaps such a formula holds for any two numbers…. </p>
<div probnum="3" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000012111"></a>
<p><a name="prob:listatob"></a> Given two integers <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span>, with <span></span>

<div id="a0000012113" class="solution">Solution for Problem 3:</div>
<span><a name="a0000012114"></a>
<p> We subtract <span></span>
 from each number from <span class="mathname">a</span> to <span class="mathname">b</span>, and we get a list of numbers starting at 1: </p>
<div id="a0000012116" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012117"></a>
<p> Our new list then has <span></span>
 numbers in it, so our old list does too. So the answer is <span></span>
. </p></span>
<div probnum="4" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000012119"></a>
<p><a name="prob:multsof4"></a> How many multiples of 4 are between 25 and 101? </p></div>
<div id="a0000012121" class="solution">Solution for Problem 4:</div>
<span><a name="a0000012122"></a>
<p> We see that <span></span>
, so the smallest multiple of 4 in our list is <span></span>
. Similarly, <span></span>
, so the largest multiple of 4 in our list is <span></span>
. Therefore our list is </p>
<div id="a0000012124" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012125"></a>
<p> To convert it into a list that we know how to count, we can divide each number in our list by 4: </p>
<div id="a0000012127" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012128"></a>
<p> We know how to count this list! Subtracting 6 from each number in the list gives </p>
<div id="a0000012130" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012131"></a>
<p> So there are 19 numbers in the list. Therefore, there are 19 multiples of 4 between 25 and 101. </p></span><a name="a0000012132"></a>
<p>You might have been tempted to use a little shortcut for Problem <a href="sect0080.html#prob:multsof4">4</a>: </p><a name="a0000012133"></a>
<p><div class="bogus"> We can just compute <div id="a0000012134" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div> to see there are 19 numbers in the list. </div> </p><a name="a0000012135"></a>
<p>But that “shortcut” doesn’t always work very well, as we can see in the next problem: </p>
<div probnum="5" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000012137"></a>
<p><a name="prob:multsof10"></a> </p>

<p>We know that <span></span>

</ol></div>
<div id="a0000012143" class="solution">Solution for Problem 5:</div>
<span><a name="a0000012144"></a>
<p> For this problem, it’s easy enough to just list the multiples of 10. </p>
<ol class="parts itemize">
	<li class="part"><a name="a0000012146"></a>
<p>Our list is </p>
<div id="a0000012148" class="math equation">

</div><a name="a0000012149"></a>
<p> so there are 10 multiples. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000012150"></a>
<p>Our list is </p>
<div id="a0000012152" class="math equation">

<p> so there are 9 multiples. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000012154"></a>
<p>The reason these answers are different is because 10 is in our list from part (a) but is not in our list from part (b). So the “shortcut” solution doesn’t work! You can’t count the number of multiples of 10 simply by calculating </p>
<div id="a0000012156" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012157"></a>
<p> How would you know whether the answer is 9 or 10? </p></li>
</ol></span><a name="a0000012158"></a>
<p><div class="warning"> Beware of quick shortcuts! (Unless you can explain why your “shortcut” works.) </div> <a name="a0000012159" id="a0000012159"></a> </p><a name="a0000012160"></a>
<p>Counting is not always as simple as creating a list. Many counting problems require a little more thought. Let’s look at an example: </p>
<div probnum="6" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000012162"></a>
<p>At Brown High School, there are 12 players on the basketball team. All of the players are taking at least one foreign language class. The school offers only Spanish and French as its foreign language classes. 8 of the players are taking Spanish and 5 of the players are taking both languages. How many players are taking French? </p></div><a name="a0000012163"></a>
<p>Before we work through the solution (for this problem or for any counting problem), always remember the following: </p><a name="a0000012164"></a>
<p><div class="important"> Don’t just blindly add and subtract—think about what you’re doing! </div> </p>
<div id="a0000012166" class="solution">Solution for Problem 6:</div>
<span><a name="a0000012167"></a>
<p> The players that are taking French fall into two categories: those who are also taking Spanish, and those who aren’t. If we can count the number of players in each category, then we can add those numbers together to get the total number of players taking French. </p><a name="a0000012168"></a>
<p>First, we note that the number of players taking French that are also taking Spanish is 5. (This is given in the problem statement.) </p><a name="a0000012169"></a>
<p>Next we count the number of players that are taking French but not Spanish. We’re not provided this count directly, but we can figure it out from the given data. There are 12 players on the team, and 8 of them are taking Spanish. So, <span></span>
 players are not taking Spanish. Since every player must be taking at least one language, these 4 players are taking French (and not Spanish). </p><a name="a0000012170"></a>
<p>So the number of players taking French is the sum: </p>
<div id="a0000012172" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012173"></a>
<p> Therefore the answer is <span></span>
. </p></span><a name="a0000012174"></a>
<p>We can also use a picture to solve this problem: </p>
<div class="align-center"> <img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/countingchapter1.1}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000012176"></a>
<p>The picture above is called a <span class="def">Venn diagram</span><a name="a0000012177" id="a0000012177"></a>. In the diagram we draw a circle for the players taking French and another circle for the players taking Spanish. The circles overlap because some players are taking both languages. </p><a name="a0000012178"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> We can use a Venn diagram whenever we wish to count things or people that occur in two or three overlapping groups.<a name="a0000012179" id="a0000012179"></a> </div> </p><a name="a0000012180"></a>
<p>We place dots in the circles to represent the players—one dot per player. A dot that is in the French circle but is not in the Spanish one represents a player taking French but not Spanish. A dot in the region that is in both circles represents a player taking both languages. A player taking Spanish but not French is represented by a dot inside the Spanish circle but not in the French one. Finally, a dot placed outside both circles represents a player who is in neither class. </p><a name="a0000012181"></a>
<p>Now we can use this diagram to solve the problem. We place 5 dots in the space inside of both circles, because there are 5 players in both classes. This gives the diagram below: </p>
<div class="align-center"> <img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/countingchapter1.2}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000012183"></a>
<p>Next, since there are 8 players taking Spanish, and 5 dots are already inside the Spanish circle, there must be three more dots inside the Spanish circle that aren’t in the French circle. We add these dots to the diagram: </p>
<div class="align-center"> <img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/countingchapter1.3}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000012185"></a>
<p>Since we have 12 total dots and we know there aren’t any outside both circles (since there are no players who are not taking either language), there must be 4 left that are inside the French circle but not inside the Spanish circle. After adding these dots, our diagram looks like this: </p>
<div class="align-center"> <img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/countingchapter1.4}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000012187"></a>
<p>We’ve placed all of the students on the team into the diagram. Now we can use the completed diagram to answer the problem. There are a total of 9 dots inside the French circle on the left, so there are 9 players in the French class. </p><a name="a0000012188"></a>
<p>Obviously, if the numbers in the problem were bigger, it would be a chore to draw all those dots, so we usually use numbers to represent how many dots are in each region, as in the figure below. </p>
<div class="align-center"> <img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/countingchapter1.5}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000012190"></a>
<p>Notice that we started with the 5 players in both classes rather than with the “12 total players” or the “8 players in Spanish.” This is because those 5 players are in a single region in our picture—if we instead had started with “8 players in Spanish,” we wouldn’t know how many to put in the intersection of the two circles and how many to put in the “just Spanish” section. </p><a name="a0000012191"></a>
<p><div class="important"> When using a Venn diagram, we try to start filling in the diagram using numbers that we know go into a single region of the diagram. Often, this means that we start in the middle of the diagram.<a name="a0000012192" id="a0000012192"></a> </div> </p><a name="a0000012193"></a>
<p>Let’s look at another problem that can be solved using a Venn diagram: </p>
<div probnum="7" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000012195"></a>
<p><a name="prob:countingcats"></a> Paul has 27 pet cats. 14 of them are short-haired. 11 of them are kittens. 5 of them are long-haired adult cats (not kittens). How many of them are short-haired kittens? </p></div>
<div id="a0000012197" class="solution">Solution for Problem 7:</div>
<span><a name="a0000012198"></a>
<p> We draw a Venn diagram, with one circle for cats with short hair and one circle for cats which are kittens. </p>
<div class="align-center"> <img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/countingchapter1.6}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000012200"></a>
<p>We can’t immediately use the numbers 27, 14, or 11 from the problem, because there is no single region into which we can place any of these numbers. For example, although we know that there are 14 short-haired cats, we don’t yet know how many of them are kittens (and would go in both circles) or how many of them are adults (and would go in the “short hair” circle but not in the “kittens” circle). However, we know there are 5 long-haired adult cats, and these 5 cats should be outside both circles. So we add that to our diagram by placing a “5” in the region outside both circles: </p>
<div class="align-center"> <img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/countingchapter1.7}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000012202"></a>
<p>At this point, we still can’t fill in any of the other numbers, so we’ll introduce a variable. We can call the number of cats in one of the regions inside the circles <span class="mathname">x</span>, and try to find other regions in terms of <span class="mathname">x</span>. If we can, we usually want our variable to represent the answer to our problem. So we’ll let the number of short-haired kittens (which are in the intersection of the circles) be <span class="mathname">x</span>. </p><a name="a0000012203"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> When assigning a variable, it’s usually best to let your variable represent the answer to the problem.<a name="a0000012204" id="a0000012204"></a> </div> </p><a name="a0000012205"></a>
<p>We place <span class="mathname">x</span> into our Venn diagram below: </p>
<div class="align-center"> <img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/countingchapter1.8}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000012207"></a>
<p>Since there are a total of 14 short-haired cats, and <span class="mathname">x</span> of them are kittens, we know that <span></span>
 of them are not kittens. Therefore, we place <span></span>
 in the portion of the short-haired circle that does not overlap with the kittens. Similarly, we have <span></span>
 kittens which are not short-haired. Now our Venn diagram has an entry in every region: </p>
<div class="align-center"> <img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/countingchapter1.9}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000012209"></a>
<p>Our diagram is filled and we still don’t know <span class="mathname">x</span>, so at first it seems like we might be stuck. But there’s one more piece of information that we haven’t used yet, and that’s the total number of cats, which is 27. </p><a name="a0000012210"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> If you get stuck on a problem, check if there’s some more information from the problem that you haven’t used yet. </div> </p><a name="a0000012211"></a>
<p>This means that if we add all the quantities in our diagram, we must get 27: </p>
<div id="a0000012213" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012214"></a>
<p> This simplifies to <span></span>
, so <span></span>
 is our answer. </p></span><a name="a0000012215"></a>
<p>As a check, we can fill the numbers into our diagram: </p>
<div class="align-center"> <img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/countingchapter1.10}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000012217"></a>
<p>Now, not only can we read our answer directly from the diagram (there are 3 short-haired kittens), but we can also easily check that the data from our solution matches the data given in the problem description. This lets us do a quick check that we didn’t make an obvious mistake. At a glance, we can confirm that there are 14 short-haired cats, 11 kittens, and 27 cats total. </p><a name="a0000012218"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> It’s always a good idea to check that your answer is consistent with the problem statement.<a name="a0000012219" id="a0000012219"></a> </div> </p><a name="a0000012220"></a>
<p>You will eventually (and may already) solve problems like Problem <a href="sect0080.html#prob:countingcats">7</a> without a diagram; however, you’ll likely at least visualize a diagram or a table. Keeping a Venn diagram or a table in mind will help keep the problem clear and prevent you from making careless errors. </p><a name="a0000012221"></a>
