<p>Many fractions (like <span></span>
 or <span></span>
) are easily converted to decimals (<span></span>
 and <span></span>
). But other fractions, even though they are simple in fraction form, are more difficult to write as decimals. We’ll start with the most basic example. </p><a name="a0000007072"></a>
<p>Let’s investigate how we would go about writing <span></span>
 as a decimal. </p>
<div probnum="15" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000007074"></a>
<p><a name="prob:decimalonethird"></a> </p>
<ol class="parts itemize">

<p>Round <span></span>
 to the nearest hundredth. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000007078"></a>
<p>Does this pattern continue? When will it stop? </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000007079"></a>
<p>Is it possible to write <span></span>
 as a decimal? If so, how? If not, why not? </p></li>
</ol></div>
<div id="a0000007081" class="solution">Solution for Problem 15:</div>
<span>
<ol class="parts itemize">
	<li class="part"><a name="a0000007083"></a>
<p>We can try to write <span></span>
 with a denominator of 10: </p>
<div id="a0000007085" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007086"></a>
<p> So we see that <span></span>
 is between <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, and is closer to <span></span>
. Therefore, <span></span>
 rounds (to the nearest tenth) to <span class="mathnumber">0.3</span>. </p><a name="a0000007087"></a>
<p>Another way to see this is to note that <span></span>
, so we have the inequality </p>
<div id="a0000007089" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007090"></a>
<p> But <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, hence </p>
<div id="a0000007092" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007093"></a>
<p> Thus <span></span>
 is between <span class="mathnumber">0.3</span> and <span class="mathnumber">0.4</span>. Furthermore, since 10 is closer to 9 than to 12, we know that <span></span>
 is closer to <span></span>
 than to <span></span>
, and hence <span></span>
 is closer to <span class="mathnumber">0.3</span> than to <span class="mathnumber">0.4</span>. Thus, <span></span>
 rounds (to the nearest tenth) to <span class="mathnumber">0.3</span>. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000007094"></a>
<p>We write <span></span>
 with a denominator of 100: </p>
<div id="a0000007096" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007097"></a>
<p> So we see that <span></span>
 is between <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, and is closer to <span></span>
. Therefore, <span></span>
 rounds (to the nearest hundredth) to <span class="mathnumber">0.33</span>. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000007098"></a>
<p>The pattern seems clear, but we could do one more decimal place to be sure. If we want to round <span></span>
 to the nearest thousandth, we can write <span></span>
 with a denominator of 1000: </p>
<div id="a0000007100" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007101"></a>
<p> So we see that <span></span>
 is between <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, and is closer to <span></span>
. Therefore, <span></span>
 rounds (to the nearest thousandth) to <span class="mathnumber">0.333</span>. </p><a name="a0000007102"></a>
<p>As our previous computations show, we expect to get a 3 in every decimal place to the right of the decimal point. For example, <span></span>
 rounded to the nearest millionth is <span class="mathnumber">0.333333</span>. In fact, when we round <span></span>
 to the nearest <span></span>
 (where <span class="mathname">n</span> is a positive integer), we get <span class="mathname">n</span> 3’s to the right of the decimal point. This is because </p>
<div id="a0000007104" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007105"></a>
<p> so that <span></span>
 is always between <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 and is closer to <span></span>
. Therefore, <span></span>
 rounds to <span></span>
, where there are <span class="mathname">n</span> 3’s to the right of the decimal point. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000007106"></a>
<p>At first glance, it seems as though it is impossible to write <span></span>
 as a decimal, since <span></span>
 is always between <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 no matter how many decimal places we look at. But all this means is that we can’t write <span></span>
 as a <em>finite</em> decimal. We can write <span></span>
 as the <em>infinite</em> decimal </p>
<div id="a0000007108" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007109"></a>
<p> The 3’s to the right of the decimal point never end—they go on forever! </p><a name="a0000007110"></a>
<p>You may find this quite strange. But there are at least a couple of different explanations for why it makes sense that <span></span>
 is equal to an infinite decimal. </p><a name="a0000007111"></a>
<p><em>Explanation 1: some algebra</em>. We set <span></span>
 (that is, <span class="mathname">x</span> is the number that has infinitely many 3’s to the right of the decimal point), and we’ll show that <span></span>
. When we multiply <span class="mathname">x</span> by 10, we move the decimal point 1 place to the right, so <span></span>
. Now watch what happens when we subtract <span class="mathname">x</span> from <span></span>
: </p>
<div id="a0000007113" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007114"></a>
<p> All of the 3’s to the right of the decimal point cancel when we subtract, and we are left with just <span></span>
, so <span></span>
. Dividing by 9 gives <span></span>
. So we have shown that </p>
<div id="a0000007116" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007117"></a>
<p><em>Explanation 2: long division</em>. We remember that <span></span>
, so we attempt to perform long division to compute <span></span>
. Of course, this seems a little silly at first, because we know that <span></span>
 gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 1. It’s more interesting if we first write 1 itself as an infinite decimal: </p>
<div id="a0000007119" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007120"></a>
<p> that is, 1 is equal to 1 with infinitely many 0’s after the decimal point. We can then perform the long division <span></span>
: </p>
<div id="a0000007122" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007123"></a>
<p> The above calculation shows that <span class="mathnumber">3</span> divides into <span class="mathnumber">1.000</span> giving quotient <span class="mathnumber">0.333</span> and remainder <span class="mathnumber">0.001</span>. We can see that this long division will never end! At every step we’ll be dividing 3 into 10, giving a quotient of 3 and remainder of 1, and then when we drop down another 0 from <span></span>
 we’ll be dividing 3 into 10 again, giving a quotient of 3 and remainder of 1, and then…  it never ends! We can never get 3 to divide evenly at any step of the long division, so we’ll get a quotient of <span></span>
 going on forever. </p></li>
</ol></span><a name="a0000007124"></a>
<p>So we see that the simple fraction <span></span>
 cannot be written as a decimal with only finitely many digits, but instead is the infinite decimal <span></span>
. This is called a <span class="def">repeating decimal</span>, because the digit 3 repeats forever. Decimals that do not repeat forever, like <span class="mathnumber">0.5</span> and <span class="mathnumber">0.67676</span>, are called <a name="a0000007125" id="a0000007125"></a><a name="a0000007126" id="a0000007126"></a><span class="def">terminating decimals</span> or <a name="a0000007127" id="a0000007127"></a><a name="a0000007128" id="a0000007128"></a><span class="def">finite decimals</span>. </p><a name="a0000007129"></a>
<p>We have a symbol that we use to write repeating decimals: </p>
<div id="a0000007131" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007132"></a>
<p> The bar over the 3 indicates that the 3 repeats forever. We can have decimals in which more than one digit repeats—for example </p>
<div id="a0000007134" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007135"></a>
<p> where we have a single “2” followed by a “79” that repeats forever. (We’ll see in the problems below how to deal with this sort of repeating decimal.) </p><div id="a0000007136" class="section-problems"><span class="headingtext">Section Problems</span></div>

<p> For example, <span></span>

<p><em>Solution 1: use a little algebra.</em> Let <span></span>
. Multiplying by 10 gives <span></span>
. Now be careful! Don’t make the following mistake: <div class="bogus"> Subtracting <span class="mathname">x</span> from <span></span>
 will cancel the repeating decimal, so <span></span>
, hence <span></span>
 and <span></span>
. </div> This is not what happens. The repeating decimal does cancel, but the 8 in the tenths digit of <span></span>
 does not cancel with the 2 in the tenths digit of <span></span>
. The correct subtraction is </p>
<div id="a0000007229" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007230"></a>
<p> Hence <span></span>
, so <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000007231"></a>
<p><em>Solution 2: use the fact from Problem <a href="sec-repeatingdecimals.html#prob:fractoinfdecimal">16</a>(a).</em> We’d like to use our fact from Problem <a href="sec-repeatingdecimals.html#prob:fractoinfdecimal">16</a>(a) that <span></span>
 for any digit <span></span>

 a little bit first: </p>
<div id="a0000007233" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007234"></a>
<p> Now we can use the conversion <span></span>
 to finish the computation: </p>
<div id="a0000007236" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000007237"></a>
<p>Again, we’ll use some algebra. Let <span></span>
. Since the repeating part of the decimal is a block of 2 digits, we’ll need to move the decimal point 2 places in order to get cancellation. So we multiply by 100 to get <span></span>
. Then </p>
<div id="a0000007239" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007240"></a>
<p> Thus <span></span>
, and hence we get </p>

</div><a name="a0000007243"></a>
<p> As a check, note that <span></span>

<p>Most of these we have already computed in one of the previous problems. The others we will leave for you to check on your own. </p>

<p> Those with denominator 2, 4, 5, 8, or 10 are finite, and those with denominator 3, 6, 7, or 9 are infinitely repeating. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000007259"></a>
<p>We can think about how we compute the decimal form of <span></span>
 using long division: we divide <span class="mathname">n</span> into <span></span>
. If this process stops at some point, we get a finite decimal; if this process repeats forever, then we get an infinitely repeating decimal. </p><a name="a0000007260"></a>
<p>What does it mean that the process stops? It means that <span class="mathname">n</span> divides evenly into <span></span>
 after some <em>finite</em> number of zeros. But this means that <span class="mathname">n</span> is a divisor of <span></span>
 for some finite number of zeros; that is, <span class="mathname">n</span> is a divisor of <span></span>
 for some positive integer <span class="mathname">k</span>. </p><a name="a0000007261"></a>
<p>But how can this occur—when is <span class="mathname">n</span> a divisor of <span></span>
? It’s exactly when the prime factorization of <span class="mathname">n</span> is included in the prime factorization of <span></span>
. We can compute the prime factorization of <span></span>
 as </p>
<div id="a0000007263" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007264"></a>
<p> Thus, for <span class="mathname">n</span> to be a divisor of <span></span>
, we see that <span class="mathname">n</span> can have only 2 or 5 (or both) as primes its prime factorization. Hence, <span></span>
 is a finite decimal if <span class="mathname">n</span> has only 2 or 5 (or both) in its prime factorization. If <span class="mathname">n</span> has any other prime in its prime factorization, then <span></span>
 is an infinitely repeating decimal. </p><a name="a0000007265"></a>
<p>Indeed, we see that 2, 4, 5, 8, and 10 from our list in part (a) all have only 2 or 5 as prime factors, and that 3, 6, 7, and 9 have some prime factor other than 2 and 5 (namely, 3, 6, and 9 all have 3 as a prime factor, and 7 has 7 as a prime factor). </p></li>

<p> From the sidenote in Problem <a href="sec-repeatingdecimals.html#prob:fractoinfdecimal">16</a>(c), we know that <span></span>
. In particular, the decimal repeats in blocks of 6 digits. That means that the <span></span>
, <span></span>
, <span></span>
, etc. digits of the decimal are 4, the <span></span>
, <span></span>
, <span></span>
, etc. digits of the decimal are 2, and so on. Also, every block ends on a digit that is a multiple of 6 positions to the right of the decimal point; that is, the <span></span>
, <span></span>
, <span></span>
, etc. are all at the end of a 6-digit block and hence are the digit 1. </p><a name="a0000007274"></a>
<p>So how can we tell which digit is the <span></span>
? We need to know what position of the 6-digit block corresponds to the <span></span>
 digit. We see that <span></span>
, so 100 is 4 more than a multiple of 6. Thus, to get to the <span></span>
 digit, we have 16 complete 6-digit blocks that use up <span class="mathnumber">96</span> digits, and the <span></span>
 digit is the <span></span>
 digit of the next block. Hence the digit we want is 5. </p></span>
