<a name="a0000007753"></a>
<p> <a name="a0000007754" id="a0000007754"></a> </p><a name="a0000007755"></a>
<p>There is a special type of ratio that is useful for converting between different units of measurement. Let’s illustrate how this works with a simple example. </p><a name="a0000007756"></a>
<p>We know that there are 12 inches in a foot and there are 3 feet in a yard. Suppose you want to use this information to compute the number of inches in a yard. Of course, you can probably do this problem in your head, or you may even have the answer memorized. But let’s carefully work through two methods that we can use to solve the problem. These methods will help us work through harder conversion problems, where the answer is not so obvious. </p><a name="a0000007757"></a>
<p><em>Method 1: Set up ratios.</em> We’ll use a method similar to Problem <a href="sect0044.html#prob:blotsblits">10</a> (the problem with the blits and bleets and blots). We can write ratios to express the relationships between the units: </p>
<div id="a0000007759" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007760"></a>
<p> We’d like to combine this into a 3-way ratio relating all three units. To do that, we need the “feet” amount in both 2-way ratios to match. The easiest way to do this is to multiply both parts of the first ratio by 3: </p>
<div id="a0000007762" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007763"></a>
<p> Now we can write it as a 3-way ratio: </p>
<div id="a0000007765" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007766"></a>
<p> Removing the “feet” gives us a ratio of <span></span>
, so there are 36 inches in a yard. </p><a name="a0000007767"></a>
<p><em>Method 2: Use conversion factors.</em> If we write the ratios from Method 1 as fractions, then we have what are called <span class="def">conversion factors</span>. To help us keep track of what’s going on, we’ll write the units as part of the fraction. So we’d write </p>
<div id="a0000007769" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007770"></a>
<p> (For consistency, we usually write all units in plural, so we write the weird-looking “1 feet” instead of “1 foot.”) Multiplying the conversion factors together will cancel the “feet” and leave us with a conversion factor relating inches to yards: </p>
<div id="a0000007772" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007773"></a>
<p> So there are 36 inches in a yard. </p><a name="a0000007774"></a>
<p>Compare the two methods used above. They’re really the same thing! The conversion factors from Method 2 are just a convenient way for us to keep track of the ratios from Method 1. </p><a name="a0000007775"></a>
<p>There are two key ideas to keep in mind when using conversion factors. First, </p><a name="a0000007776"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> Think of conversion factors as fractions that are equal to 1. </div> </p><a name="a0000007777"></a>
<p>For example, we know that there are 12 inches in a foot, so we think of </p>
<div id="a0000007779" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007780"></a>
<p> In other words, the quantities “12 inches” and “1 feet” are <em>equal quantities</em>, so it makes sense to write them equal to each other in an equation. Going one step further, this then makes the fraction </p>
<div id="a0000007782" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007783"></a>
<p> The right way to think about this is as a fraction with equal numerator and denominator, so of course it is equal to 1. Also, we can just as easily write its reciprocal too: </p>
<div id="a0000007785" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007786"></a>
<p> Our second key idea about conversion factors is: </p><a name="a0000007787"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> We multiply conversion factors together to cancel units. </div> </p><a name="a0000007788"></a>
<p>We see this concept if we revisit our earlier computation: </p>
<div id="a0000007790" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007791"></a>
<p> All we’re doing is multiplying two fractions on the left that are each equal to 1, so naturally (since <span></span>
) the quantity on the right side of the equation is also equal to 1. But we also notice that the “feet” units cancel. You might see this more clearly if we put in some missing steps in the above calculation: </p>
<div id="a0000007793" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007794"></a>
<p>The beauty of this is that it helps us prevent mistakes. For example, if we incorrectly tried to combine conversion factors as: </p>
<div id="a0000007796" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007797"></a>
<p> we see that the units don’t cancel properly, so we probably made a mistake somewhere. </p><a name="a0000007798"></a>
<p>Conversion factors make it easy to convert units. For example, suppose we want to convert the length “6 yards” into inches. We know that a conversion factor is just a fraction that equals 1, and multiplying “6 yards” by 1 doesn’t change the length. Therefore, we have </p>
<div id="a0000007800" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007801"></a>
<p> But now the units nicely cancel, and we can finish the computation: </p>
<div id="a0000007803" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007804"></a>
<p> Notice how the “yards” units cancelled, and we are left with just the “inches” units, as we want. Therefore, 6 yards is equal to 216 inches. </p><div id="a0000007805" class="section-problems"><span class="headingtext">Section Problems</span></div>

<div probnum="17" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000007813"></a>
<p><a name="prob:yardstoinches"></a> How many yards equals 90 inches? </p></div>
<div id="a0000007815" class="solution">Solution for Problem 17:</div>
<span><a name="a0000007816"></a>
<p> We discovered above that 1 yard is equal to 36 inches. To convert 90 inches into yards, we start with the quantity “90 inches” and multiply by the appropriate conversion factors until we get something with the units “yards.” In this case, it’s easy: we just need a conversion factor with inches in the denominator (to cancel the inches in our initial quantity) and yards in the numerator (so we’ll be left with yards). Our calculation is: </p>
<div id="a0000007818" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007819"></a>
<p> Thus, 90 inches is the same as 2.5 yards. </p></span><a name="a0000007820"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> The reason the calculation in Problem <a href="sect0045.html#prob:yardstoinches">17</a> works is that the conversion factor is equal to 1. That is, because <span></span>
, the fraction <span></span>
 is equal to 1. Therefore, multiplying 90 inches by this fraction is the same as multiplying by 1, and hence the length does not change. </div> </p>
<div probnum="18" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000007822"></a>
<p>A tablespoon is half of a fluid ounce, a cup is 8 fluid ounces, and a gallon is 16 cups. How many tablespoons are in a gallon? </p></div>
<div id="a0000007824" class="solution">Solution for Problem 18:</div>
<span><a name="a0000007825"></a>
<p> We want to convert “1 gallon” into some number of tablespoons. But we don’t have a single gallons-to-tablespoons conversion factor. Instead, we have to use the multiple conversion factors that we are given in the problem statement. First, we show a step-by-step solution. </p><a name="a0000007826"></a>
<p>We first convert gallons to cups. We don’t really need a “conversion factor” for this, since we can just read this data from the problem statement: </p>
<div id="a0000007828" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007829"></a>
<p> Next, we convert cups to ounces, using the cups-to-ounces conversion: </p>
<div id="a0000007831" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007832"></a>
<p> Finally, we convert ounces to tablespoons (abbreviated tbsp): </p>
<div id="a0000007834" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007835"></a>
<p> So there are 256 tablespoons in a gallon. </p><a name="a0000007836"></a>
<p>But conversion factors are nice in that we can use more than one of them at the same time. In particular, we could do the gallon-to-tablespoons conversion all at once: </p>
<div id="a0000007838" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007839"></a>
<p> As long as we are sure that each conversion factor equals 1 (meaning that its numerator and denominator represent the same quantity), and that the units cancel properly, we can line up as many conversion factors as might be necessary to do a complicated conversion. </p></span><a name="a0000007840"></a>
<p>We can use conversion factors whenever we wish to compare two different units—they don’t necessarily have to be typical “measurements” like length or volume. For example: </p>
<div probnum="19" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000007842"></a>
<p>Will took <span></span>
 on his trip to Japan, where the exchange rate between dollars and yen is <span></span>
. He spent <span></span>
 on his hotel room and <span></span>
 on meals and souvenirs. How much money (in dollars) did he have remaining at the end of his trip? </p></div>
<div id="a0000007844" class="solution">Solution for Problem 19:</div>
<span><a name="a0000007845"></a>
<p> <em>Method 1: Convert and then convert back.</em> When Will went to Japan, his dollars became: </p>
<div id="a0000007847" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007848"></a>
<p> This is just like any other conversion: notice how the conversion factor <span></span>
 equals 1 because ¥90 equals $1, and notice how the $ units cancel leaving us with the desired ¥ units. After his spending, he was left with </p>
<div id="a0000007850" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007851"></a>
<p> When Will got home, he converted his remaining yen back into dollars: </p>
<div id="a0000007853" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007854"></a>
<p> So Will had $375 dollars remaining after his trip. </p><a name="a0000007855"></a>
<p><em>Method 2: Convert just the spending.</em> Rather than convert Will’s entire bankroll to yen and then convert it back, we can just figure out how much he spent in dollars. His total spending was <span></span>
, so in dollars this is </p>
<div id="a0000007857" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007858"></a>
<p> Thus Will spent the equivalent of <span></span>
 on his trip, and had <span></span>
 remaining. </p></span>
<div probnum="20" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000007860"></a>

<p> <em>Method 1: Reason geometrically.</em> A square inch is the area of a square that is 1 inch on each side. But this same square is 2.5 centimeters on each side, so its area is <span></span>
 square centimeters. </p><a name="a0000007871"></a>
<p><em>Method 2: Use conversion factors.</em> We wish to convert from square inches (written <span></span>
