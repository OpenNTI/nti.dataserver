<p>A dot. A speck. In geometry, it’s a <span class="def">point</span>. If you lived on a point, you’d be awfully bored. There would be no up and down, no right and left. You couldn’t move any amount in any direction. </p>

<p> <a name="fig:itsapoint"></a>  </p></div><a name="a0000009737"></a>
<p>In order to tell one point from another, we usually label them with capital letters, such as point <span class="mathname">P</span> in Figure <a href="section-measureangle.html#fig:itsapoint">10.1</a> above. </p>

<p> Now, say you got so bored on one point that you just had to go to another point. A straight path from one point to another is called a <span class="def">line segment</span>, or just a <span class="def">segment</span>. The two points at the ends of a segment are called the <a name="a0000009743" id="a0000009743"></a><span class="def">endpoints</span> of the segment. We use these endpoints to label the segment. For example, <span></span>
 in Figure <a href="section-measureangle.html#fig:itsasegment">10.2</a> is the segment connecting <span class="mathname">A</span> and <span class="mathname">B</span>. </p><a name="a0000009744"></a>
<p>If we continue a segment forever past its endpoints in both directions, we form a <span class="def">line</span>. </p>

<p>Line <span></span>
 is shown in Figure <a href="section-measureangle.html#fig:itsaline">10.3</a>. We sometimes use a lowercase letter to identify a line, such as line <span class="mathname">k</span> in the figure. The arrows at the ends indicate that the line continues forever in both directions. We often leave off these arrows in diagrams. </p><a name="a0000009750"></a>
<p>If we instead continue the segment forever past only one endpoint, we’ll trace out a path called a <span class="def">ray</span>. The starting point of a ray is called the ray’s <span class="def">origin</span>, so point <span class="mathname">A</span> is the origin of the ray below. </p>

<p> <a name="fig:itsaray"></a> </p></div><a name="a0000009755"></a>
<p>We refer to the ray in Figure <a href="section-measureangle.html#fig:itsaray">10.4</a> as <span></span>

 When two rays share an origin, they form an <span class="def">angle</span>. In the diagram at the left, rays <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 share origin <span class="mathname">O</span>. The common origin is called the <a name="a0000009757" id="a0000009757"></a><span class="def">vertex</span> of the angle, and the rays <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 are called the <a name="a0000009758" id="a0000009758"></a><span class="def">sides</span> of the angle. We use the symbol <span></span>
 to indicate an angle, and we use a point on each side and the vertex to identify the angle. So, we can refer to the angle on the left as <span></span>
. When it’s very clear what angle we’re talking about, we can just refer to it with the vertex: <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000009759"></a>
<p>Notice that when we write the angle as <span></span>
, we put the vertex in the middle. We could also refer to the angle as <span></span>
, but not as <span></span>
. Sometimes we don’t have to use three letters to refer to an angle. When it’s very clear what angle we’re talking about, we can just name it with the vertex: <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000009760"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_9.pdf}" align="bottom">

 Two intersecting lines also make angles. Lines <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 at the right intersect at <span class="mathname">P</span>. Here, we can’t just write <span></span>
, since there are many different possible angles this could mean, such as <span></span>
, <span></span>
, <span></span>
, or <span></span>
. We might even be referring to <span></span>
. Intersecting segments (including those that share an endpoint, such as <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 in the diagram) also form angles. </p><a name="a0000009761"></a>
<p>Now that we know what angles are, we need a way to measure them so that we can compare one angle to another. </p>
<div id="pageprotractor" class="figure"><a name="a0000009763"></a>
<p><img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/geometry_21.pdf}" style="width:; height:">

<div class="caption"><b>Figure 10.5</b>: <span>A Protractor</span></div><a name="a0000009765"></a>
<p> <a name="fig:firstprot"></a> </p></div><a name="a0000009766"></a>
<p>Just as we use a ruler to measure the lengths of segments, we use a <a name="pageprotractor"></a><span class="def">protractor</span> to measure angles. Roughly speaking, an angle’s measure is how “open” the angle is. Our protractor above shows half a circle (which we call a <span class="def">semicircle</span>) divided into 180 equal pieces. Each of these little pieces is one <span class="def">degree</span> of the semicircle, so that an entire semicircle consists of 180 degrees. A full circle can be split into two semicircles, and each of these semicircles consists of 180 degrees. So, a full circle has 360 degrees. We use the symbol <a name="a0000009767" id="a0000009767"></a><span></span>
 for degrees, so that a whole circle is <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000009768"></a>
<p><div class="sidebar"><a name="a0000009769"></a>
<p>Using 360 for the number of degrees in a circle comes from the ancient Babylonians. The Babylonians used a number system with 60 digits, instead of our decimal system, which only has 10 digits. When choosing a number of degrees for a whole circle, they were likely influenced by their number system and possibly by astronomy (a year has around 360 days). </p><a name="a0000009770"></a>
<p> 360 is also a convenient choice for the number of degrees in a circle because it is divisible by lots of different numbers. We often work with angles whose measures are <span></span>
, <span></span>
, <span></span>
, or <span></span>
 of a circle. Using 360 as the number of degrees in a circle makes all of these angles have integer degree measures. Had we used 100 degrees for a circle instead, we’d have to deal with measures such as <span></span>
 degrees, <span></span>
 degrees, and so on. </p></div> </p>

<p>Figure <a href="section-measureangle.html#fig:measureangle">10.6</a> shows how we use a protractor to measure an angle. We place the protractor on the angle so that the vertex of the angle is at the center point of the protractor, and one side of the angle is along the “zero line” along the bottom of the protractor. We then read that there are 62 degrees between sides <span></span>

<div id="a0000009800" class="solution">Solution for Problem 1:</div>
<span><a name="a0000009801"></a>
<p> Here are the steps we follow to use our protractor to measure angles: </p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li value="1"><a name="a0000009803"></a>
<p>Place the protractor on the angle so that the vertex of the angle is exactly where the center of the circle would be if the protractor were a whole circle. Your protractor should clearly show this center point: it’s near the middle of the straight side. </p></li><li value="2"><a name="a0000009804"></a>
<p>Turn the protractor so that one side of the angle is along the “zero line,” which is the line through the center point along the straight edge of the protractor. </p></li><li value="3"><a name="a0000009805"></a>
<p>Find where the other side of the angle meets the curved side of the protractor. (We may need to extend this side of the angle to reach the curved side of the protractor.) There should be two numbers where this side meets the curved edge. If less than half the protractor’s semicircle is inside the angle, then the measure of the angle is the smaller number of degrees. Otherwise, the measure is the larger number of degrees. If the numbers are equal, then both equal the measure of the angle. </p></li>
</ol><a name="a0000009806"></a>
<p> <div class="xtra"> <em>[The universe] cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word.</em><br>–Galileo Galilei </div> </p><a name="a0000009807"></a>
<p>For <span></span>
, we put our protractor on the page as shown below. We line up side <span></span>
 of the angle with the zero line of the protractor, placing the center point of the protractor over <span class="mathname">O</span>. We find that side <span></span>
 hits the curved edge at <span></span>
. </p>
<div class="align-center"><img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/geometry_23.pdf}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000009809"></a>
<p> When we follow this procedure with <span></span>
, we find that there are two numbers where <span></span>
 meets the curved edge in the following diagram. Since <span></span>
 is less than half the entire semicircle, its measure must be the smaller of the two numbers where <span></span>
 meets the curved edge of the protractor. So, we have <span></span>
. </p>
<div class="align-center"><img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/geometry_24.pdf}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000009811"></a>
<p> We can also use the diagram above to find the measure of <span></span>
. Once again, our angle hits a point on the curved edge with two numbers, but this time we know the angle is greater than <span></span>
 (since the angle is more than half the semicircle). Thus, we know that <span></span>
. We can also use this placement of the protractor to measure <span></span>
. Since <span></span>
 meets the curved edge of the protractor at <span class="mathnumber">116</span> and <span></span>
 hits it at <span class="mathnumber">80</span>, we see that <span></span>
 cuts off <span></span>
 degrees. So, we have <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000009812"></a>
<p>We could also have placed the protractor as in the diagram below to find that <span></span>

<div class="align-center"><img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/geometry_25.pdf}" style="width:; height:">

<p>Notice that <span></span>
. This isn’t a coincidence! Since <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 share a side and a vertex, putting them together gives <span></span>
. If two angles share a vertex and a side, we call the angles <a name="a0000009815" id="a0000009815"></a><a name="a0000009816" id="a0000009816"></a><span class="def">adjacent</span>. </p></span><a name="a0000009817"></a>

 We saw in Problem <a href="section-measureangle.html#prob:angmeas2">1</a> that knowing whether an angle is greater than or less than <span></span>
 is necessary for finding its measure using a protractor. This <span></span>
 is such an important measure that <span></span>

<p>The twelve hour marks are evenly spaced around the clock, so each two consecutive marks are <span></span>

 The Bogus Solution is incorrect because the hour hand moves between 5:00 and 5:24, too! During a full hour, the hour hand moves 30 degrees, since it moves from one hour mark to the next mark. So, in 24 minutes, the hour hand moves <span></span>
 of 30 degrees, which is </p>

<p> degrees. The minute hand moves <span></span>
 degrees each minute. At 5:25, the minute hand will point at the 5 o’clock mark on the clock. So, at 5:24, the minute hand is 6 degrees shy of the 5 o’clock mark. Since the hour hand is 12 degrees past the 5 o’clock mark on the clock, the angle between the hands measures <span></span>
 degrees. </p></li>

<p>Another way we can think about the location of the hour hand is to think about how much the hour hand moves each minute. Since the hour hand moves 30 degrees in an hour, it moves 0.5 degrees each minute. So, in 24 minutes, it moves 12 degrees past minute 25. The minute hand is 6 degrees before minute 25 at 5:24, so the two hands are 18 degrees apart. </p></li>
