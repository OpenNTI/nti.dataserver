<div id="a0000009953" class="solution">Solution for Problem 9:</div>
<span><a name="a0000009954"></a>
<p> In the diagram to the right, we have parallel lines <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, and we have added line <span></span>
, which meets <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 at <span class="mathname">A</span> and <span class="mathname">B</span>, respectively. We call a line that cuts across parallel lines a <span class="def">transversal</span>. Measuring all 8 angles in the diagram, we find the measures shown. There are two groups of 4 equal angles! </p><a name="a0000009955"></a>
<p>We could have seen that some of these angles are equal without using a protractor. We must have <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 because these are pairs of vertical angles. But why are the acute angles at <span class="mathname">A</span> equal to the acute angles at <span class="mathname">B</span>? </p><a name="a0000009956"></a>
<p>One way to see why is to imagine sliding line <span></span>
 on top of <span></span>
 so that point <span class="mathname">B</span> is on top of point <span class="mathname">A</span>. Then, <span></span>
 would be right on top of <span></span>
. This isn’t a proof, but it does give us some idea why these angles have the same measure. </p><a name="a0000009957"></a>
<p>Each obtuse angle in the diagram can be combined with one of the acute angles to form a straight line. So, each obtuse angle is supplementary to each acute angle. </p></span><a name="a0000009958"></a>
<p><div class="important"><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_41.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 The angles formed when a transversal intersects two parallel lines come in two groups of four equal angles as shown: <div class="align-center"> <span></span>
</div>   Each of the first set of angles is supplementary to each of the second set of angles. That is, the sum of any angle in the first group and any angle in the second group is <span></span>
. So, either all 8 angles are right angles, or 4 of them are acute while the other 4 are obtuse. </div> </p><a name="a0000009959"></a>

<p> When a transversal intersects parallel lines, equal angles come in groups of four as we saw in Problem <a href="section-parallellines.html#prob:parangle">9</a>. Therefore, we know that <span></span>
. We also know that each angle in the other “group of four” has a measure that is supplementary to <span></span>

<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_332.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 We have seen that a transversal forms two sets of four equal angles when it intersects two parallel lines. We can use these relationships in reverse! That is, we can use the angle relationships we just learned to figure out when lines are parallel. </p><a name="a0000009966"></a>
<p>For example, in the diagram at the right, line <span class="mathname">j</span> intersects lines <span class="mathname">k</span> and <span></span>
. If we can determine that <span></span>
 or <span></span>
, then we know that <span></span>
. Similarly if we determine that <span></span>
 or <span></span>
, then we know that <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000009967"></a>
<p>Now that we understand the relationships between angles when a transversal intersects parallel lines, let’s try a more challenging problem. </p><a name="a0000009968"></a>
<p><div probnum="11" type="picproblem" class="problem"><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_42.pdf}" align="bottom">

 A chicken starts at point <span class="mathname">X</span> on one side of a road. It starts walking across the road along a path that makes a <span></span>
 angle with the side of the road, as shown. Before making it to the other side, the chicken makes a sharp turn (at point <span class="mathname">Y</span>) and starts along a new path, which makes a <span></span>
 angle with the old path, as shown. If the opposite sides of the road are parallel, what is the measure of the acute angle that the path of the chicken makes with the far side of the road at point <span class="mathname">Z</span>?<a name="prob:chickencrossroad"></a> <br> </div> </p>
<div id="a0000009970" class="solution">Solution for Problem 11:</div>
<span><a name="a0000009971"></a>
<p> We’d like to use what we know about parallel lines and angles, but neither <span></span>
 nor <span></span>
 intersects both sides of the road. So, we add a third line, through point <span class="mathname">Y</span> and parallel to both sides of the road, as shown in the diagram below. We’ll label this line <span></span>
, and let the sides of the road be <span class="mathname">j</span> and <span class="mathname">k</span>. Both <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 are transversals that intersect a pair of parallel lines. Now we can use what we know about angles and parallel lines. </p>
<div class="align-center"><img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/geometry_43.pdf}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000009973"></a>
<p>Since <span></span>
, we know that the acute angle that <span></span>
 makes with <span></span>
 equals the acute angle <span></span>
 makes with <span class="mathname">j</span>. We include this information in the diagram by writing <span></span>
 inside <span></span>
 in our diagram. We then find <span></span>
 by subtracting <span></span>
 from the value of <span></span>
 that we are given in the problem. We find that </p>
<div id="a0000009975" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000009976"></a>
<p> Finally, because <span></span>
, the acute angle that <span></span>
 makes with <span class="mathname">k</span> is congruent to the acute angle <span></span>
 makes with <span></span>
. So the path of the chicken makes a <span></span>
 angle with the far side of the road. </p></span><a name="a0000009977"></a>
<p>As seen in Problem <a href="section-parallellines.html#prob:chickencrossroad">11</a>, parallel lines are so helpful that sometimes we add an extra parallel line to a problem in order to find a solution. </p><a name="a0000009978"></a>
