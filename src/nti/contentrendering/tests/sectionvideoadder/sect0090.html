<div id="a0000012856" class="solution">Solution for Problem 5:</div>
<span><a name="a0000012857"></a>
<p> It would take way too long to test every single two-digit number. We narrow our search by first focusing on just one of the properties. But which one? <div class="concept"> When faced with several restrictions in a problem, it’s often best to consider the most restrictive first. </div> Each of the first three properties is satisfied by quite a few two-digit numbers, but there aren’t many two-digit multiples of 12. So, we start by listing the multiples of 12: </p>
<div id="a0000012859" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012860"></a>
<p> Now that we have a short list of possible solutions, we can quickly go through the other properties and eliminate possibilities from this list. Since the tens digit must be larger than the ones digit, we can eliminate the first four numbers in the list, leaving </p>
<div id="a0000012862" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012863"></a>
<p> The next property, that the difference between the digits is greater than 3, eliminates 96: </p>
<div id="a0000012865" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012866"></a>
<p> Finally, since the sum of the digits must be greater than 10, we can eliminate 60 and 72, and we are left with 84 as the answer to the problem. </p></span>
<div probnum="6" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000012868"></a>
<p>Elizabeth spent exactly <span></span>
 for some <span class="mathnumber">15</span>-cent stamps and some <span class="mathnumber">31</span>-cent stamps. How many <span class="mathnumber">15</span>-cent stamps did she buy?<a name="prob_solve:31cent"></a> </p></div>
<div id="a0000012870" class="solution">Solution for Problem 6:</div>
<span><a name="a0000012871"></a>
<p> We often start word problems by assigning variables and writing equations. Let’s try that here. First, we note that <span></span>
 is 700 cents. If we let <span class="mathname">a</span> be the number of <span class="mathnumber">15</span>-cent stamps and <span class="mathname">b</span> be the number of <span class="mathnumber">31</span>-cent stamps, then we must have </p>
<div id="a0000012873" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012874"></a>
<p> That’s all we know about <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span>, and this equation isn’t terribly helpful. We could just guess values of <span class="mathname">a</span> or <span class="mathname">b</span> and hope we get lucky, but there are a lot of possibilities. </p><a name="a0000012875"></a>
<p>Instead, we take a more organized approach. After paying for all the <span class="mathnumber">31</span>-cent stamps, the amount remaining must be divisible by 15 cents. So, we imagine that Elizabeth starts with 700 cents and pays for the <span class="mathnumber">31</span>-cent stamps one at a time. We then list the number of cents she has remaining at each step, looking for a multiple of 15: </p>
<div id="a0000012877" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012878"></a>
<p> Since <span class="mathnumber">390</span> is divisible by both 3 and 5, it is divisible by 15. Elizabeth spent <span></span>
 cents on 31-cent stamps, so she bought 10 31-cent stamps. With the other 390 cents, she bought <span></span>
 <span class="mathnumber">15</span>-cent stamps. </p><a name="a0000012879"></a>
<p>You might have noticed that we could have saved a lot of work with a little bit of thinking. Instead of buying the <span class="mathnumber">31</span>-cent stamps one at a time, we might have noticed that the number of <span class="mathnumber">31</span>-cent stamps she bought must have been a multiple of 5. This is the only way the number of cents left for 15-cent stamps could be a multiple of 5. So, we can shorten our list by buying five <span class="mathnumber">31</span>-cent stamps at a time. Each block of five <span class="mathnumber">31</span>-cent stamps costs <span></span>
 cents, so our list is </p>
<div id="a0000012881" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012882"></a>
<p> We reach the desired multiple of 15 much faster this way! Furthermore, it’s easy with this method to see why there are no other combinations she could have bought. If we continue the list, we have </p>
<div id="a0000012884" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012885"></a>
<p> The only multiple of 15 in this list is 390. So, the only way she can buy 31-cent stamps and 15-cent stamps is if she spends 390 cents on 15-cent stamps and 310 cents on 31-cent stamps. </p></span><a name="a0000012886"></a>
<p>In the previous problem, we saw that doing a little bit of thinking before listing can sometimes shorten the amount of listing you have to do. In the next problem, we see that sometimes we need to do some careful thinking just to make sure we have a complete list. </p>
<div probnum="7" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000012888"></a>
<p>A <span class="def">partition</span> of a positive integer <span class="mathname">n</span> is a way of writing <span class="mathname">n</span> as the sum of positive integers in which the order of the numbers in the sum doesn’t matter. For example, the partitions of 3 are 3, <span></span>
, and <span></span>
. We consider <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 to be the same, so there are 3 partitions of 3. How many partitions of 6 are there?<a name="prbsolv:partition"></a> </p></div>
<div id="a0000012890" class="solution">Solution for Problem 7:</div>
<span><a name="a0000012891"></a>
<p> If we just start listing partitions of 6 as we think of them, it will be hard to know when we’ve found them all. So, we should take an organized approach. <div class="concept"> Organized lists are much more useful than disorganized lists. </div> </p><a name="a0000012892"></a>
<p>One way to organize the partitions is to group them based on the largest number in the partition. Obviously, there’s only one partition that has 6, namely </p>
<div id="a0000012894" class="math equation">

</div><a name="a0000012895"></a>
<p> Similarly, there’s only one partition in which 5 is the largest number: </p>
