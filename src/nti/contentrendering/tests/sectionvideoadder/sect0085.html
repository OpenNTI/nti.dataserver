<p>In this chapter, we learned how to use arithmetic to solve counting problems. </p><a name="a0000012640"></a>
<p><div class="important"> Don’t just blindly add, subtract, multiply, and divide—think about what you’re doing! </div> </p><a name="a0000012641"></a>
<p>Counting a list of numbers like <span></span>
 is easy! Counting many other lists of numbers is easy too: use arithmetic to convert it into a list that looks like 1,2,3,…. The number of items in the list <span></span>
, where <span></span>
 are integers, is <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000012642"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> When presented with a complicated problem, try to reduce or simplify it to a simpler problem that you know how to solve. </div> </p><a name="a0000012643"></a>
<p>Counting items which lie in one or more overlapping sets requires a thoughtful use of addition and subtraction. We can use a Venn diagram to help keep track of the thought process. When using a Venn diagram, we should initially try to fill in numbers that correspond exactly to a single region of the diagram. We may have to place variables in our diagram: if so, it’s usually wise to choose our variable to represent the answer to the problem. </p><a name="a0000012644"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> When assigning a variable, it’s usually best to let your variable represent the answer to the problem. </div> </p><a name="a0000012645"></a>
<p>When counting multiple independent events, we multiply: the number of ways that <span class="mathname">A</span> <b class="bfseries">and</b> <span class="mathname">B</span> can occur is </p>
<div id="a0000012647" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012648"></a>
<p> Sometimes our later choices depend on our earlier choices, so our counting must take that into consideration. </p><a name="a0000012649"></a>
<p>Casework can often help us break a counting problem into more manageable pieces. We split the possibilities into exclusive cases, meaning that every outcome shows up in exactly one case. Then, to count the total, you simply add the counts for each case. Casework requires you to be organized and careful, and to make sure that you don’t omit any outcomes in your cases. </p><a name="a0000012650"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> When faced with a series of independent choices, one after the other, we <b class="bfseries">multiply</b> the number of options at each step. When faced with exclusive options (meaning we can’t choose more than one), we <b class="bfseries">add</b> the number of options. </div> </p><a name="a0000012651"></a>
<p>To count pairs of items, we first count the number of ways to select 2 items from our group, and then divide by 2 because we’ve counted each pair twice (once in each order). In general, if we have <span class="mathname">n</span> items, then there are <span></span>
 pairs of items. </p><a name="a0000012652"></a>
<p><div class="important"> For any positive integer <span class="mathname">n</span>, <div id="a0000012653" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div> </div> </p><a name="a0000012654"></a>
<p>If all outcomes are <em>equally likely</em>, then the probability of success is </p>
<div id="a0000012656" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000012657"></a>
<p> It is very important that all of the outcomes are equally likely! </p><a name="a0000012658"></a>
<p>When working on a probability problem, if you ever get a probability that’s less than 0 or greater than 1, then you’ve made a mistake! All probabilities are greater than or equal to 0, and less than or equal to 1. </p><a name="a0000012659"></a>
<p>Most probability problems are just two counting problems: counting the number of total outcomes and counting the number of successful outcomes. So we can take advantage of all of the counting techniques that we’ve learned to solve probability problems as well. </p></div>
