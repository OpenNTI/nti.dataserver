<p>So far we’ve primarily dealt with expressions that are equal. In this section, we deal with expressions that are <em>not</em> equal. If we know that one expression is greater than another, we can write an <span class="def">inequality</span> to show this relationship. For example, </p>
<div id="a0000006111" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006112"></a>
<p> The <span></span>
 symbol means “greater than,” so <span></span>
 tells us that <span></span>
 is greater than 5. <a name="a0000006113" id="a0000006113"></a><a name="a0000006114" id="a0000006114"></a>We could also write this relationship with 5 on the left side: </p>
<div id="a0000006116" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006117"></a>
<p> The <span></span>
 symbol means “less than,” so <span></span>
 tells us that 5 is less than <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000006118"></a>
<p>Both of the inequalities above are <a name="a0000006119" id="a0000006119"></a><a name="a0000006120" id="a0000006120"></a><span class="def">strict inequalities</span>, since one side must be larger than the other. We can also write <a name="a0000006121" id="a0000006121"></a><a name="a0000006122" id="a0000006122"></a><span class="def">nonstrict inequalities</span>, in which one side is greater than or equal to the other. The <a name="a0000006123" id="a0000006123"></a><span></span>
 symbol means “greater than or equal to,” so </p>
<div id="a0000006125" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006126"></a>
<p> means <span></span>
 is greater than or equal to 9. Similarly, the <a name="a0000006127" id="a0000006127"></a><span></span>
 symbol means “less than or equal to.” </p><a name="a0000006128"></a>
<p>Just as with equations, we can include variables in inequalities, such as: </p>
<div id="a0000006130" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006131"></a>
<p> This tells us that <span class="mathname">x</span> is greater than 5. For example, <span class="mathname">x</span> could be 6 or <span></span>
, but could not be <span class="mathnumber">-2</span>. We can graph the values of <span class="mathname">x</span> that satisfy the inequality on the number line, as shown below: </p>
<div class="align-center"><img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/equations_9.pdf}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000006133"></a>
<p>We <a name="a0000006134" id="a0000006134"></a><a name="a0000006135" id="a0000006135"></a>draw an open circle at <span class="mathnumber">5</span> on the number line to indicate that <span></span>
 is not a valid solution to the inequality <span></span>
. (It is not a valid solution because <span class="mathnumber">5</span> is not greater than 5.) We bold the portion of the number line that corresponds to values of <span class="mathname">x</span> that satisfy the inequality. Note that we bold the arrow on the positive end of the number line. This indicates that all the numbers beyond the arrow in that direction are also solutions to the inequality. </p><a name="a0000006136"></a>
<p>Just as we use an open circle to mark the end point of a strict inequality like <span></span>
, we use a closed circle to mark an end point of a nonstrict inequality. So, we can graph the solutions to <span></span>
 on the number line as shown below: </p>

<p>Similarly, if they each donate 100 million dollars to the Art of Problem Solving Foundation (a very fine idea, we think), then each of them will have their wealth changed by the same amount.

<p>We’ll use another Bill Gates and Warren Buffett example to get a sense for what this part is telling us. Suppose that Bill starts with more money than Warren has. Then, imagine they both win a contest in which Bill wins more money than Warren wins. Since Bill started with more money than Warren, and then Bill’s money increased by more than Warren’s increased, Bill must end with more money than Warren. </p><a name="a0000006205"></a>

<p>Unfortunately, we can’t use the same process we used in part (a). </p><a name="a0000006226"></a>
<p>We need to prove something about products. One thing we know about products and inequalities is that the product of two positive numbers is greater than 0. So, let’s see if we can use that. </p><a name="a0000006227"></a>
<p>We already have one positive number, <span></span>
. Because <span></span>
, we can subtract <span class="mathname">y</span> from (or add <span></span>
 to) both sides of the inequality to get <span></span>
. So, we have another positive number, <span></span>
. The product of the positive numbers <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 must be positive, so we have </p>
<div id="a0000006229" class="math equation">

</div><a name="a0000006230"></a>
<p> Expanding the left side gives <span></span>

 to both sides gives <span></span>
. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006231"></a>
<p>We can use the same steps as in the previous part. Subtracting <span class="mathname">y</span> from both sides of <span></span>
 gives <span></span>
. The product of the two positive numbers <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span></span>
 must be positive: </p>
<div id="a0000006233" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006234"></a>
<p> Expanding the left side gives <span></span>
, and adding <span class="mathname">ay</span> to both sides gives <span></span>
. </p></li>
</ol></span><a name="a0000006235"></a>
<p>Now we have some rules for multiplying inequalities by positive numbers. </p><a name="a0000006236"></a>
<p><div class="important"> If <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, then <span></span>
.<br>If <span></span>

<p>These rules take care of division, too, since dividing by a number is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. For example, if <span></span>

<p>Our experiments suggest that when we multiply both sides of an inequality by <span class="mathnumber">-2</span>, we must <em>reverse the inequality sign</em>. </p><a name="a0000006259"></a>
<p>We do know what happens when we multiply both sides of an inequality by a positive number. So, instead of starting by multiplying both sides of <span></span>
 by <span class="mathnumber">-2</span>, we start by multiplying both sides by positive 2. This gives us <span></span>

<p>Our key step in investigating multiplying an inequality by a positive number was noticing that the product of two positive numbers is positive. To use this fact, we subtracted <span class="mathname">y</span> from both sides of <span></span>
 to get <span></span>
. Next, we noted that multiplying <span></span>
, which is positive, by a positive number gives a positive result. What if we instead multiply <span></span>

<p>Now that we know how to work with inequalities, let’s turn to solving inequalities that have variables. Solving an equation with a variable means finding what values of the variable make the equation true. Similarly, solving an inequality that has a variable means describing exactly what values of the variable make the inequality true. </p>
<div probnum="30" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000006285"></a>
<p>In each of the following parts, describe the values of the variable that make the inequality true, and graph those values on the number line. </p><a name="a0000006286"></a>

<p>The inequality states that <span class="mathname">r</span> must be larger than <span class="mathnumber">-2</span> and less than or equal to 4. We particularly note that <span></span>
 satisfies <span></span>
, but <span></span>
 does not. We graph the solutions on the number line below: </p>
<div class="align-center"><img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/equations_2.pdf}" style="width:; height:">
 </div><a name="a0000006297"></a>
<p>Notice that we use an open circle at <span class="mathnumber">-2</span> to indicate that <span class="mathnumber">-2</span> is not a solution, and we use a closed circle at <span class="mathnumber">4</span> to show that <span class="mathnumber">4</span> is a solution. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006298"></a>
<p>We know how to describe the solutions to an inequality in which the variable is alone on one side of the inequality and a constant is on the other side. So, we try to isolate <span class="mathname">x</span> using the rules we have learned in this section for working with inequalities. We start by subtracting 7 from both sides, which gives <span></span>
. Dividing both sides by 2 gives <span></span>
. So, the original inequality is satisfied by all values of <span class="mathname">x</span> that are less than <span class="mathnumber">-5</span>. We graph these solutions on the number line below: </p>
<div class="align-center"><img alt="\includegraphics{../Images/equations_3.pdf}" style="width:; height:">
 </div></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000006300"></a>
<p>We start by expanding the product on the left side with the distributive property. This gives </p>
<div id="a0000006302" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006303"></a>
<p> Subtracting <span></span>
 from both sides gives <span></span>
. Subtracting 15 from both sides gives <span></span>
. Our next step is dividing both sides by <span class="mathnumber">-8</span> to isolate <span class="mathname">y</span>, but we have to be careful. When we divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality symbol. So, dividing <span></span>
 by <span class="mathnumber">-8</span> gives <span></span>
, not <span></span>
. We graph the solutions on the number line below: </p>

</ol></span><a name="a0000006305"></a>
<p>When we solve an inequality, we obviously can’t test all of the possible answers in the way that we can check our answer to an equation. For example, in part (c) of the previous problem, we found that all values of <span class="mathname">y</span> for which <span></span>
 are solutions to <span></span>
. We certainly can’t test every single value that’s less than or equal to 3. But we can test a few, just to make sure. For example, <span></span>
 does satisfy the original inequality, since <span></span>
. Also, when <span></span>
, both sides of <span></span>
 equal <span class="mathnumber">-3</span>, so the inequality is satisfied. Meanwhile, <span></span>
 does not satisfy the original inequality, since <span></span>
 and <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000006306"></a>
<p>These quick checks are particularly helpful at catching errors with signs or with the direction of the inequality. Suppose we had gotten the direction of the inequality wrong and finished with <span></span>
, or made a sign error and finished with <span></span>
. The quick checks we just did would have revealed that we made a mistake somewhere. </p>

<p>My town has two cell phone providers. The provider DontTalkMuch charges <span></span>
 per month, plus 1 dollar per hour. The provider TalkLots charges <span></span>
 per month, plus 4 dollars per hour. How much do you have to use your phone in a month in order for DontTalkMuch’s deal to be better for you? </p></div>
<div id="a0000006310" class="solution">Solution for Problem 31:</div>
<span><a name="a0000006311"></a>
<p> The cost of each provider depends on the number of hours of usage per month. So, we start by letting <span class="mathname">h</span> be the number of hours of phone usage per month. DontTalkMuch charges <span></span>
 per month plus <span></span>
 for each of the <span class="mathname">h</span> hours, for a total of <span></span>
 dollars per month. TalkLots charges <span></span>
 per month plus <span></span>
 for each of the <span class="mathname">h</span> hours, for a total of <span></span>
 dollars per month. </p><a name="a0000006312"></a>
<p>We seek the values of <span class="mathname">h</span> for which DontTalkMuch costs less than TalkLots. Therefore, we must have </p>
<div id="a0000006314" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006315"></a>
<p> Subtracting <span class="mathname">h</span> and 20 from both sides gives <span></span>
. Dividing by <span class="mathnumber">3</span> gives <span></span>
. Therefore, DontTalkMuch offers the better deal whenever you talk more than 20 hours in a month. </p></span>

<p> Adding <span></span>

. </p><a name="a0000006324"></a>
<p>Tommy can’t give away cards a fractional number of times, so the smallest that <span class="mathname">d</span> can be is 45. So, the first time I’ll have more cards than Tommy is just after he has given away cards 45 times. At that point, I will have <span></span>
 cards and he will have <span></span>
