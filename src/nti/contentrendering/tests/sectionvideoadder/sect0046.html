<p>You are probably already familiar with the idea of <span class="def">speed</span>. Speed is a measure of how fast something is moving. </p><a name="a0000007889"></a>
<p>For example, suppose a car is traveling at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour. After 1 hour, it has traveled 40 miles; after 2 hours, it has traveled 80 miles; after 3 hours, it has traveled 120 miles, and so on. Notice that the ratio of distance traveled (in miles) to time traveled (in hours) is always constant: </p>
<div id="a0000007891" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007892"></a>
<p> In general, if the car travels for <span class="mathname">x</span> hours, it will have traveled <span></span>
 miles, for a ratio of distance to time of <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000007893"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> Speed is the ratio of distance to time. </div> </p><a name="a0000007894"></a>
<p>We can write “speed is the ratio of distance to time” as the equation </p>
<div id="a0000007896" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007897"></a>
<p> This equation can be rearranged as </p>

<p> and also as </p>

</div><a name="a0000007903"></a>
<p> The units associated with speed help us remember these equations. For example, the speed of a car (in the U.S.) is usually given in “miles per hour,” abbreviated “mph.” The word <span class="def">per</span> essentially means “divided by,” so a speed in miles per hour means to take distance (in miles) and divide by time (in hours). So, for instance, a car that travels 110 miles in 2 hours is traveling at a speed of </p>
<div id="a0000007905" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007906"></a>
<p> Similarly, a car that travels at a speed of 70 miles per hour for 2 hours covers a distance of: </p>
<div id="a0000007908" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007909"></a>
<p>We can also think of speed as a type of conversion factor, one that converts between time and distance. To repeat our previous example, a car that travels at a speed of 70 miles per hour for 2 hours is essentially “converting” the 2 hours of time into a distance, as </p>

<span><a name="a0000007934"></a>
<p> In each of these three types of computation, simply keeping track of the units will show us what to do. </p>
<ol class="parts itemize">
	<li class="part"><a name="a0000007936"></a>
<p>The car travels 75 miles during each hour that it travels, so in 2.6 hours it travels <span></span>
 miles. </p><a name="a0000007937"></a>
<p>We can think about the units to see why we should multiply the speed <span></span>
 by the time <span class="mathnumber">2.6</span> hours to get the distance traveled in miles. Multiplying these two allows us to cancel out the “hours”: </p>
<div id="a0000007939" class="math equation">

<p>If the truck travels 238 miles at a constant speed in 3.5 hours, then it must travel <span></span>
 miles in each hour. Therefore, its speed is <span class="mathnumber">68</span> miles per hour. </p><a name="a0000007941"></a>
<p>Again, we can think about units to realize that we should divide. Our answer is a speed, so its units should be “miles per hour.” Thus, we divide the distance (in miles) by the time (in hours): </p>

<p>If a motorcycle covers 80 miles in each hour, then it will cover 420 miles in <span></span>
 hours. </p><a name="a0000007945"></a>
<p>As with the first two parts, thinking about units can help us see why we divide. Our answer is time, so it should be expressed in “hours.” Thus, we have to divide distance (in miles) by speed (in miles per hours) to end up with an answer in terms of hours: </p>

<p> One minute 30 seconds is <span></span>
 minutes, so the train’s speed is </p>

</div></span><a name="a0000007962"></a>
<p>Another way to solve Problem <a href="sect0046.html#prob:speedtrain">23</a> is to reason as follows: the number of “1 minute 30 second” intervals in a 60-minute hour is <span></span>

<p>If you walk for 45 minutes at a rate of 4 mph and then run for 30 minutes at a rate of 10 mph, then how many miles have you gone at the end of one hour and 15 minutes? What was your average speed for the journey? <span class="source">(Source: AMC 8)</span> </p></div>
<div id="a0000007966" class="solution">Solution for Problem 24:</div>
<span><a name="a0000007967"></a>
<p> We can compute the walking distance and running distances separately, then add them. You walk for 45 minutes, which is <span></span>
 hours, at a rate of 4 mph, so the walking distance is <span></span>
. You run for 30 minutes, which is <span></span>
 hour, at a rate of 10 mph, so the running distance is <span></span>

<p> You might think: <div class="bogus"> Shelly drove half of her trip at 75 mph and the other half of her trip at 50 mph. Therefore, her average speed is just the average of the speeds from the two halves of the trip, which is <span></span>

</div><a name="a0000007979"></a>
<p> The trip from the office to the home was 50 miles at 50 mph, so it takes 1 hour. Thus, the entire 100-mile trip takes <span></span>

<p>Ben leaves his house at 7 a.m. and bikes at a constant speed of 15 miles per hour due east. Alisha lives 100 miles due east of Ben, leaves her house at 8 a.m., and bikes at a constant speed of 10 miles per hour due west. At what time do they meet? </p></div>
<div id="a0000007991" class="solution">Solution for Problem 26:</div>
<span><a name="a0000007992"></a>
<p> There are a couple of different ways we could approach this. </p><a name="a0000007993"></a>
<p><em>Method 1: Set up an equation.</em> Let <span class="mathname">t</span> be the time of day in hours—it makes sense to make this our variable since this is what we’re trying to find in the problem. We can also imagine the houses as being on the number line, where Ben’s house is at 0 and Alisha’s house is at 100. </p><a name="a0000007994"></a>
<p>Ben starts cycling at 7 a.m., and he moves right (along our imaginary number line) at 15 miles per hour. So his position at time <span class="mathname">t</span> is <span></span>
. Alisha starts cycling at 8 a.m., and she moves left at 10 miles per hour. So her position at time <span class="mathname">t</span> is <span></span>
. (Note the minus sign in front of the 10, because she is moving to the left.) </p><a name="a0000007995"></a>
<p>They meet when their positions are equal, so at the time that they meet we have </p>
<div id="a0000007997" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007998"></a>
<p> Expanding this equation gives <span></span>
, and simplifying gives <span></span>
. So <span></span>
. Therefore, we could say that they meet at <span class="mathnumber">11.4</span> a.m., but of course this is not how we normally express the time of day. This is <span></span>
 minutes past 11 a.m., so they meet at 11:24 a.m. </p><a name="a0000007999"></a>
<p><em>Method 2: Think about how the people are moving relative to each other.</em> We notice that in the first hour (between 7 and 8 a.m.), only Ben is moving, and he covers 15 miles. Therefore, at 8 a.m., the two people are <span></span>
 miles apart. </p><a name="a0000008000"></a>
<p>After 8 a.m., since Ben and Alisha cover a combined 25 miles per hour between them, they reduce the distance between them at a rate of 25 miles per hour. They will meet when this distance is reduced all the way to 0. Since they start with 85 miles between them at 8 a.m., and they reduce this distance at a rate of 25 miles per hour, it will take them <span></span>
 hours to reduce the distance between them all the way to 0. So they will meet <span class="mathnumber">3.4</span> hours after 8 a.m., which is <span class="mathnumber">11.4</span> a.m. as in Method 1. Again, converting to minutes gives <span></span>
 minutes past 11 a.m., so they meet at 11:24 a.m. </p></span><a name="a0000008001"></a>
<p>Method 2 above uses the following important idea: </p><a name="a0000008002"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> When there are two people or objects moving simultaneously, it is often easiest to keep track of the distance between the objects, rather than trying to keep track of the objects separately. </div> </p><a name="a0000008003"></a>

<ol class="parts itemize">

<p>We can think of Yogi and Boo-Boo as being 400 meters apart at the start, because they have to run a combined 400 meters until they will meet again. They reduce the distance between them at a rate of <span></span>
 meters per second. So they will meet after <span></span>
 seconds. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000008012"></a>
<p>When they run in the same direction, we think of the distance between them as increasing. The rate at which the distance is increasing is the difference in their speeds, which is <span></span>
 meters per second. They meet when Yogi “laps” Boo-Boo, meaning when Yogi has increased his lead over Boo-Boo to 400 meters, or an entire lap, and thus Yogi catches Boo-Boo from behind. Since Yogi’s lead increases by 2 meters per second, he will catch Boo-Boo after <span></span>
 seconds. </p></li>
