<p>While perimeter gives us a way of measuring the boundary of a closed figure, we use <span class="def">area</span> to measure the space contained inside the figure. </p><a name="a0000010448"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_87.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 The square at the right has sides of length 1 inch. We say that the area of this square is “1 square inch,” where “square inch” is a unit of area just like “inch” is a unit of length. If the sides of the square were 1 foot long, then the square’s area would be “1 square foot.” Rather than writing out “square inch” or “square foot,” we sometimes abbreviate the units using an exponent: “1 square inch” can be written “1 in<span></span>
,” and “1 square foot” can be written “1 ft<span></span>
.” </p><a name="a0000010449"></a>
<p>If we leave the units out and have a square with side length 1, then its area is “1 square unit,” but we usually leave the “square units” out and just say that the area is 1. We call a square with side length 1 a <span class="def">unit square</span>. </p><a name="a0000010450"></a>
<p>Of course, we’d like to find the area of more than just squares with side length 1! We can think of the area of a figure as the number of unit squares that are needed to cover the figure. As you probably know, the area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width. </p><a name="a0000010451"></a>

<p>Finally, we sometimes use brackets to refer to area, so we write <span></span>

<span><a name="a0000010481"></a>
<p> Problem <a href="section-area.html#prob:firstrighttriarea">6</a> gives us a guide for finding the formula. We start with a rectangle with sides of length <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span>. This rectangle has area <span class="mathname">ab</span>. Drawing a diagonal of the rectangle produces two right triangles, each with legs of length <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span>. As in the previous problem, these right triangles have the same area, so the area of each is half the area of the rectangle. Therefore, the area of a right triangle with legs of length <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span> is <span></span>
. </p></span><a name="a0000010482"></a>

<p>We’ll often use the term “legs” to refer to the lengths of the legs rather than the segments themselves. So, for example, we can write that the area of a right triangle is half the product of its legs. </p>

<p>Ravi’s triangle is a right triangle, so its area is half the product of its legs. This means Ravi’s triangle has area <span></span>
 square feet. </p><a name="a0000010497"></a>

 </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000010498"></a>
<p>We only know how to find the areas of rectangles and right triangles, but Ranu’s triangle is neither of these. So, we split Ranu’s triangle into pieces we can handle. We draw a segment from the top vertex of Ranu’s triangle to the floor such that this segment is perpendicular to the floor. This segment has length 8 feet because the top of the room is 8 feet from the floor. Ranu’s original triangle is now divided into two right triangles, and we know how to find the area of right triangles. </p><a name="a0000010499"></a>
<p>Unfortunately, we don’t know the lengths of both legs of the right triangles. However, we don’t need to know them! Our extra segment divides the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles. Ranu’s triangle covers half of each of these rectangles, so her triangle covers half of the original rectangle, just like Ravi’s does. Therefore, the area of Ranu’s triangle is the same as the area of Ravi’s triangle, <span></span>
 square feet. </p><a name="a0000010500"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_321.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 We also could have used a little algebra to see that the area of Ranu’s triangle is half the area of the rectangle. We label the vertices as shown at right. We then have </p>
<div id="a0000010502" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000010503"></a>
<p>  Since <span class="mathname">BC</span> equals the length of rectangle <span class="mathname">EBCF</span> and <span class="mathname">AD</span> equals the width, we see that the area of <span></span>
 is indeed half the area of <span class="mathname">EBCF</span>. </p></li>
</ol></span><a name="a0000010504"></a>
<p>It’s quite a coincidence that Ravi’s triangle and Ranu’s triangle turned out to have the same area. Or is it? Let’s investigate. To do so, we’ll use the same key strategy we used to find the area of Ranu’s triangle: </p><a name="a0000010505"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> If you don’t know how to find the area of a figure, try breaking the figure into pieces you can handle. </div> </p>

 </p>
<div id="a0000010510" class="solution">Solution for Problem 9:</div>
<span><a name="a0000010511"></a>
<p> Let <span class="mathname">ABC</span> be an acute triangle. We’ll approach finding the area of <span></span>
 in the same way that we found the area of Ranu’s triangle in Problem <a href="section-area.html#prob:trianglepaint">2</a>. We draw a line segment from <span class="mathname">A</span> to <span></span>
 such that the new segment is perpendicular to <span></span>
. We call this new segment an <span class="def">altitude</span> of the triangle. The altitude <span></span>
 divides <span></span>
 into two right triangles, <span></span>
 and <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000010512"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_67.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 Next, we’ll build a rectangle around <span></span>
, to play the role that the wall played in Problem <a href="section-area.html#prob:trianglepaint">2</a>. The length of the rectangle is <span class="mathname">BC</span> and its width equals <span class="mathname">AD</span>, so the area of the rectangle is <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000010513"></a>
<p><span></span>
 divides the larger rectangle into two smaller rectangles, and <span></span>
 covers exactly half of each of these rectangles. Therefore, <span></span>
 covers half of the larger rectangle, which means that the area of <span></span>
 is <span></span>
. </p></span><a name="a0000010514"></a>
<p><div class="important"> To find the area of an acute triangle, we select one side to be the <a name="a0000010515" id="a0000010515"></a>base of the triangle.

<div></div>


</div> <div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_66.pdf}" align="bottom">

 For example, in triangle <span class="mathname">ABC</span> shown, <span></span>
 is the altitude to base <span></span>
, and we have <div id="a0000010517" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div> </div> </p><a name="a0000010518"></a>
<p>The length of an altitude of a triangle is sometimes also called a <a name="a0000010519" id="a0000010519"></a><a name="a0000010520" id="a0000010520"></a><span class="def">height</span> of the triangle. We can think of the area of a triangle as “Half the base length times the height.” </p><a name="a0000010521"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_248.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 Each side of a triangle can be considered a base of the triangle. Therefore, each triangle has three altitudes, one for each base. For example, <span></span>
 at the right has altitudes <span></span>
, <span></span>
, and <span></span>
, and we can write the area of the triangle using any of these: </p>
<div id="a0000010523" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000010524"></a>
<p>  <div class="sidebar"> We say that three lines are <a name="a0000010525" id="a0000010525"></a><span class="def">concurrent</span> if they share a common point.<a name="page:orthocenter"></a> As suggested by the altitudes of <span></span>
 above, the three altitudes of any triangle are concurrent. The point at which the three altitudes meet is called the <a name="a0000010526" id="a0000010526"></a><span class="def">orthocenter</span> of the triangle. </div> </p><a name="a0000010527"></a>
<p><div class="leftpic"><img alt="\leftpic{geometry_73.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 Our area rule works for right triangles, too! In a right triangle, each leg is an altitude to the other leg of the triangle. For example, in right triangle <span class="mathname">PQR</span> on the left, the leg <span></span>
 is also the altitude from <span class="mathname">Q</span> to leg <span></span>
. So, our formula from Problem <a href="section-area.html#page:orthocenter">9</a> suggests that the area is <span></span>
, which does indeed match the formula we already know for the area of a right triangle. </p><a name="a0000010528"></a>
<p><div class="xtra"> Back on page <a href="sec-perimeter.html#text:triineq">Measuring Segments</a>, we learned that if the side lengths of a triangle are <span class="mathname">a</span>, <span class="mathname">b</span>, and <span class="mathname">c</span>, then <span></span>
. There’s a very similar inequality for the three heights of a triangle. If <span class="mathname">x</span>, <span class="mathname">y</span>, and <span class="mathname">z</span> are the heights from the three vertices of a triangle, then <div id="a0000010529" class="math equation">

</div> Why must this inequality be true? </div> </p>

<p>Ravi and Ranu are expanding their house so that the wall that was 18 feet by 8 feet before will become 25 feet by 8 feet. Ravi still wants a triangle that reaches from one corner to the opposite corner, but he doesn’t want to use any more paint than he used for his triangle on the old wall.

<p> If we try the same strategy as in Problem <a href="section-area.html#page:orthocenter">9</a>, we run into a problem.

<p>Fortunately, we have some shapes in the diagram whose areas we can find easily. Right triangle <span class="mathname">AXC</span> has area <span></span>
 ft<span></span>

. The lengths of the legs of <span></span>

 feet and <span></span>
 feet, so the area of <span></span>

</div><a name="a0000010541"></a>
<p>Ranu is correct! The area is the same as before, even though the new triangle extends all the way out to the new corner. </p></span><a name="a0000010542"></a>
<p>We can extend our earlier triangle area rule, to make a rule that works for any triangle. </p><a name="a0000010543"></a>
<p><div class="important"> To find the area of a triangle, we select one side to be the “base” of the triangle. The perpendicular segment from the vertex opposite the base to the line containing the base is the <span class="def">altitude</span> to that base.<a name="a0000010544" id="a0000010544"></a><a name="a0000010545" id="a0000010545"></a> The area is <div id="a0000010546" class="math equation">

 The only new part of this rule is that we included “the line containing” in the definition of “altitude.” In other words, we sometimes have to extend the base of a triangle in order to draw the altitude to that base. For example, in obtuse triangle <span class="mathname">ABC</span> on the right, to draw the altitude from <span class="mathname">C</span>, we first extend side <span></span>
 past <span class="mathname">A</span>. The altitude is the dashed segment from <span class="mathname">C</span> perpendicular to the extended side. </p><a name="a0000010548"></a>

 Tina wants to carpet a room that has the unusual shape shown on the right with solid lines. Each dotted square in the diagram has side length 5 feet. What is the area of Tina’s carpet?<br> </div> </p>
<div id="a0000010560" class="solution">Solution for Problem 12:</div>
<span><a name="a0000010561"></a>
<p> We don’t have a nice formula for such an oddly shaped region. Fortunately, we can break the region up into pieces we can handle. We’ll show two different approaches. </p><a name="a0000010562"></a>
<p><em>Method 1: Break up the region into rectangles and triangles.</em> There are lots and lots of ways we can do this. On the right below, we’ve shown one way that produces rectangles and triangles that we can handle easily. Remembering that each of the dotted squares has side length 5 feet, we can find the areas of the pieces as shown, in square feet. </p><a name="a0000010563"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_75.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 For example, the rectangle in the upper left has length <span></span>
 feet and width <span></span>
 feet, so its area is <span></span>
 square feet. The right triangle in the upper right has legs with lengths <span></span>
 feet and <span></span>
 feet, so its area is <span></span>
 square feet. </p><a name="a0000010564"></a>
<p>Next, consider the triangle in the lower left. Its vertical side has length <span></span>
 feet. The altitude to this side consists of four dotted square side lengths, so the altitude has length <span></span>
 feet. The area of this triangle then is <span></span>
 square feet. In a similar way, we can find the areas of the other two pieces. </p><a name="a0000010565"></a>
<p>Adding together the areas of the five regions gives a total of <span class="mathnumber">1075</span> square feet. </p><a name="a0000010566"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{geometry_76.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 <em>Method 2: View the desired region as what’s left when rectangles and triangles are cut away from a larger rectangle.</em> Here, we think of Tina’s room as what’s left when we start with a big rectangle and cut away pieces. One way to do so in a way that allows us to compute the area is shown at the right. The large rectangle has length <span></span>
 feet and width <span></span>
 feet, so it has area <span></span>
 ft<span></span>
. We then find the areas of the three triangle pieces outside Tina’s room as shown in the diagram. To get the area of Tina’s room, we subtract the areas of these triangular pieces from the area of the large rectangle. Again, we find that Tina’s room has area <span></span>
 square feet. </p></span><a name="a0000010567"></a>

 We noted back on page <a href="section-area.html#page:orthocenter">Area</a> that the altitudes of a triangle are concurrent at a point we call the orthocenter. How does this happen in an obtuse triangle? In an obtuse triangle, two of the altitudes don’t even go inside the triangle! But if we draw the lines containing the altitudes, then these lines are concurrent at a point outside the triangle. An example is shown at the right. An obtuse triangle is shown in bold, and the three lines containing the triangle’s altitudes meet at the orthocenter, which is outside the triangle. </p><a name="a0000010586"></a>
