<p>You know how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. In fact, you may already know how to solve many of the problems in this chapter. So why do we start this book with an entire chapter on arithmetic? </p><a name="a0000000143"></a>
<p>To answer this question, go back to the title of this book: <b class="bfseries"><em>Prealgebra</em></b>. What is prealgebra? Not everybody agrees on what “prealgebra” means, but we (the writers of this book) like to think of prealgebra as the bridge between <em>arithmetic</em> and <em>algebra</em>. </p><a name="a0000000144"></a>
<p><em>Arithmetic</em> refers to the basics of adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and (maybe) more exotic things like squares and square roots. You probably learned most of these basics already. The hardest thing that you usually do in arithmetic is “word problems” like “If Jenny has 5 apples and Timmy has 7 apples, then how many apples do they have together?” As you get older, the numbers get bigger, but the problems don’t really get much harder. Arithmetic is great when trying to solve simple problems like counting apples. But when the problems get more complicated—like trying to compute a rocket’s trajectory, or trying to analyze a financial market, or trying to count the number of ways a text message can be routed through a cellular phone network—we need a more advanced toolbox. </p><a name="a0000000145"></a>
<p>That toolbox is <em>algebra</em>. Algebra is the language of all advanced mathematics. Algebra gives us tools to take our concepts from arithmetic and make them <em>general</em>, meaning that we can use the concepts not just for arithmetic problems, but for other sorts of problems, too. </p><a name="a0000000146"></a>
<p>To take a simple example, you can use arithmetic to show that </p>
<div id="a0000000148" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000000149"></a>
<p> because the left side equals <span></span>
, which is 16, and the right side equals <span></span>
, which is also 16. But algebra gives us the much more general tool that </p>
<div id="a0000000151" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000000152"></a>
<p> no matter what numbers <span class="mathname">a</span>, <span class="mathname">b</span>, and <span class="mathname">c</span> are. And in higher mathematics, <span class="mathname">a</span>, <span class="mathname">b</span>, and <span class="mathname">c</span> might not even be numbers as you recognize them now, but might be more complicated mathematical objects. (Even more generally, “<span></span>
” and “<span></span>
” might not mean addition and multiplication as you think of them now, but instead might represent more complicated mathematical operations. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves a little bit!) </p><a name="a0000000153"></a>
<p>So our initial goal, in Chapter <a href="chapter-arithmetic.html">1</a>, is to carefully lay down the rules of arithmetic, and to give you some ideas as to <em>why</em> these rules are true. Once you know the rules, you’ll be ready to start thinking algebraically. </p><a name="a0000000154"></a>
<p>Also, by the time you start reading this book, you are mathematically mature enough to start thinking about not just <em>how</em> to perform various calculations, but <em>why</em> the techniques used in those calculations work. Understanding why mathematics works is the key to solving harder problems. If you only understand how techniques work but not why they work, you’ll have a lot more difficulty modifying those techniques to solve more complicated problems. So, throughout this book, we will rarely just tell you how something works—we’ll usually show you why it works. </p><a name="a0000000155"></a>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you should be able to explain <em>why</em> the following computations are true: </p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li><a name="a0000000157"></a>
<p><span></span>
 (and not <span class="mathnumber">-35</span>) </p></li><li><a name="a0000000158"></a>
<p><span></span>
 (and be able to compute this in your head!) </p></li><li><a name="a0000000159"></a>
<p><span></span>
 </p></li><li><a name="a0000000160"></a>
<p><span></span>
 (again, in your head!) </p></li>
</ul><a name="a0000000161"></a>
<p> You’ll know all these things not because you’ve blindly applied some calculation, or because you’ve memorized some formula—instead, you’ll understand the mathematics behind all these expressions. </p><a name="a0000000162"></a>
<p>Unfortunately, different mathematicians and different textbooks may use slightly different words for the same concept, in the same way that what an American calls a “truck” is called a “lorry” by people in Great Britain. So, before we go any farther, we want to make sure that we all agree on some of the words that we’re going to use. </p>

<p>The <a name="a0000000165" id="a0000000165"></a><span class="def">number line</span> is shown above. It goes on forever in both directions. Every number that we will consider in this book is somewhere on the number line. The tick marks<a name="a0000000166" id="a0000000166"></a> on the number line above indicate the <span class="def">integers</span><a name="a0000000167" id="a0000000167"></a>. An integer is a number without a fractional part: </p>
<div id="a0000000169" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000000170"></a>
<p> (The symbol <span></span>
 at either end of the above list means that the list goes on forever in that direction. The <span></span>
 symbol is called an <a name="a0000000171" id="a0000000171"></a><span class="def">ellipsis</span>.) However, as you know, there are many numbers on the number line other than integers. For instance, most fractions such as <span></span>
 are not integers. (But some fractions are integers—we’ll explore this further in Chapter <a href="chapter-fractions.html">4</a>.)<a name="a0000000172" id="a0000000172"></a> </p><a name="a0000000173"></a>
<p>A number is called <span class="def">positive</span> if it is to the right of 0 on the number line. In other words, a number is positive if it is greater than <span class="mathnumber">0</span>. A number is called <span class="def">negative</span> if it is to the left of 0 on the number line. That is, a number is negative if it is less than <span class="mathnumber">0</span>. For example, <span class="mathnumber">2</span> is positive, while <span class="mathnumber">-2</span> is negative. Note that <span class="mathnumber">0</span> itself is neither positive nor negative, and that every number is either positive, negative, or 0. </p><a name="a0000000174"></a>
<p>A number is called <span class="def">nonnegative</span> if it is not negative. In other words, a nonnegative number is positive or 0. Similarly, a number is called <span class="def">nonpositive</span> if it is not positive. Finally, a number is called <span class="def">nonzero</span> if it is not equal to <span class="mathnumber">0</span>. Note that <span class="mathnumber">0</span> is nonnegative and nonpositive. </p><a name="a0000000175"></a>
<p><div class="sidebar"><a name="a0000000176"></a>
<p>A lot of people use the term <span class="def">whole number</span> to mean a nonnegative integer. In other words, a whole number is one of the numbers <span class="mathnumber">0</span>, <span class="mathnumber">1</span>, <span class="mathnumber">2</span>, …. These same people use the term <span class="def">natural number</span> to mean a positive integer. In other words, a natural number is one of the numbers <span class="mathnumber">1</span>, <span class="mathnumber">2</span>, <span class="mathnumber">3</span>, …. </p><a name="a0000000177"></a>
<a name="a0000000178"></a>
<p>However—and this is the really irritating part—a lot of people use the term <span class="def">natural number</span> to mean a nonnegative integer. In other words, a natural number is one of the numbers <span class="mathnumber">0</span>, <span class="mathnumber">1</span>, <span class="mathnumber">2</span>, …. These same people use the term <span class="def">whole number</span> to mean a positive integer. In other words, a whole number is one of the numbers <span class="mathnumber">1</span>, <span class="mathnumber">2</span>, <span class="mathnumber">3</span>, …. </p><a name="a0000000179"></a>
<a name="a0000000180"></a>
<p>And some of both of these groups of people might also use the term <span class="def">counting number</span> to mean either whole number or natural number. </p><a name="a0000000181"></a>
<a name="a0000000182"></a>
<p>These people have been arguing for centuries, and they will likely never agree. Since we don’t like to argue, we will stick with the very clear terms <span class="def">positive integers</span> for the numbers <span class="mathnumber">1</span>, <span class="mathnumber">2</span>, <span class="mathnumber">3</span>, …, and <span class="def">nonnegative integers</span> for the numbers <span class="mathnumber">0</span>, <span class="mathnumber">1</span>, <span class="mathnumber">2</span>, …. </p></div> </p><a name="a0000000183"></a>
<p><a name="a0000000184" id="a0000000184"></a> </p></div>
