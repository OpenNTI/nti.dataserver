 Members of the Gross Pie Association were asked for their favorite type of pie. The results of the poll are shown in the <span class="def">pie chart</span> at the right. Pie charts are typically circular, and sliced into pieces that represent different categories. The sizes of the pieces correspond to the portion of the whole that each category represents. So, for example, the ``Pickle'' piece is nearly half the chart, because nearly half the people chose pickle pie. If 36 of the members chose cat-hair pie, then how many chose sawdust pie?<br> </div>

<p>The <span></span>
 grade has the most students. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000011863"></a>
<p>Since each school has the same number of grades, the school with the largest number of students has the highest average number of students per grade. So, South Middle School has the largest average number of students per grade. (South Middle School has 1023 students, so its average number of students per grade is <span></span>
.) </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000011864"></a>
<p>This year’s <span></span>
 grade students will be next year’s <span></span>
 grade students. So, to see if a school needs more <span></span>
 grade teachers next year, we need to compare the number of <span></span>
 grade students this year to the number of <span></span>
 grade students this year. East, West, and South Middle Schools have fewer <span></span>
 graders than <span></span>
 graders, so they probably won’t need more <span></span>
 grade teachers next year. North Middle School has 100 more <span></span>

<ol class="parts itemize">

<p>The number of students who think most about history is a little more than 10. The bar for history doesn’t make it halfway between 10 and 20, so there are fewer than 15 students who think most about history. Three times 15 is 45, and the bar for math goes a little higher than 50. So, the number of students who think most about math is definitely more than three times the number who think most about history; hence, the statement in the problem is true. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000011880"></a>
<p>The number of students who think most about Wii is between 35 and 40, and the number who think most about Rubik’s Cube is between 25 and 30. So, the sum of these is at least <span></span>
. This total is definitely greater than the number of students who think most about math; hence, the statement in the problem is false. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000011881"></a>
<p>More students think most about Facebook than think most about any of the other options. However, the other options combined have a lot more students total than Facebook—in particular, the sum of the students thinking most about just Math or Wii looks to be about <span></span>
, which is already definitely larger than the number of students thinking most about Facebook. Thus, less than half the students think most about Facebook, and the statement in the problem is false. </p><a name="a0000011882"></a>
<p><div class="sidebar"> When considering a set of people divided into groups, we use the word <span class="def">plurality</span> to describe the group that consists of the most number of people. If the plurality consists of more than half the total number of people, then we say that it is a <span class="def">majority</span> of the people. So, the students who think about Facebook the most in this problem are a plurality of the students, but not a majority. </div> </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000011883"></a>
<p>The bar for Wii is higher than that for the Rubik’s Cube, but that only tells us that more students think about Wii <em>most of all</em> than think about Rubik’s Cube <em>most of all</em>. We don’t know anything about the other students. They might think about Rubik’s Cube a lot without thinking about Wii at all. So, it’s possible that most of the students spend more time thinking about Rubik’s Cube than thinking about Wii.

<p>It sure looks like The Bots were behind The Little Monsters at the start of Monday, but way ahead of The Little Monsters at the end of Friday. But take a close look at the numbers on the graphs. The numbers on The Little Monsters’ graph range from 100 to 500. The numbers on The Bots’ graph also start at 100, but only go up 2 each time, to 108 at the largest. The Little Monsters’ graph shows that their score was around 300 the whole week, while The Bots’ score was always below 108. So, The Bots did start the week behind The Little Monsters, but The Bots were still far behind at the end of the week—the statement in the problem is false. </p><a name="a0000011900"></a>
<p>We sometimes use the term <span class="def">scale</span> to refer to the numbers used along an axis of a graph or chart. The scales in the two graphs are very different. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000011901"></a>
<p>It looks like The Bots’ score skyrocketed from Monday to Friday, while The Little Monsters’ score only went up a tiny bit. But again, the scales of the two graphs are misleading. The Bots’ score went from 99 points to 107 points, a gain of 8 points. It’s hard to tell exactly how much The Little Monsters’ score changed over the week, but it appears that they started close to 300 points and ended about a quarter of the way from 300 to 400. So, The Little Monsters probably earned around 25 points or so, total, which means The Little Monsters earned more points between Monday and Friday than The Bots. Thus, the statement in the problem is false. (The Bots probably chose the scale of their graph to make it look like they earned a ton of points!) </p><a name="a0000011902"></a>
<p><div class="warning"> Pay attention to the scales of graphs, particularly when two different quantities are being compared with graphs. Graphs can be made very misleading by strategically choosing the scale. </div> </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000011903"></a>
<p>The Bots ended Tuesday and Wednesday with the same number of points, so they didn’t earn any points on Wednesday. The statement in the problem is true. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000011904"></a>
<p>It’s very hard to tell from the graph whether or not The Little Monsters’ total increased on Wednesday. So, we can’t tell for sure from the graph whether or not The Little Monsters had a day on which they earned no points. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000011905"></a>
<p>The Little Monsters’ graph goes upward from Thursday to Friday, but it’s impossible to tell from the graph by exactly how much. So we can’t tell if the statement in the problem is true or false. If The Little Monsters had chosen a different scale for their graph, then it might be easier to answer questions about their exact scores. </p></li>

<p>While the first two parts of Problem <a href="sect0075.html#prob:potter">13</a> show us how the scale of a graph can be used to mislead or confuse, the last three parts show us that the choice of scale of a graph can determine how accurately we can read the graph. </p><a name="a0000011910"></a>

<p>The same point totals were used to make these two graphs, but the graphs look very different! With the graph on the right, we can determine that there isn’t a day on which The Little Monsters failed to score any points (so part (d) above is false). However, we still can’t determine whether or not The Little Monsters earned more than 24 points on Friday, so we still can’t decide whether statement (e) is true or false. </p><a name="a0000011915"></a>

<ol class="parts itemize">
	<li class="part"><a name="a0000011926"></a>
<p>To find the average, we have to sum all of the scores and divide by the total number of scores. To count the scores, we simply count the digits that are to the right of the vertical line. There are 30 such numbers. To sum the numbers, we could write out all 30 numbers and add them, but that would take quite a bit of time. We can take a slight shortcut by adding each row. The first row has three numbers with 5 as the tens digit, and the digits to the right of the line are the units digits. So, the sum of the numbers in that row is <span></span>
. Similarly, the sum of the numbers in the next row is <span></span>
. The sum of the numbers in the 70s row is <span class="mathnumber">822</span>, the sum of the 80s row is <span class="mathnumber">579</span>, and the sum of the 90s row is <span class="mathnumber">377</span>. So, the sum of all of the numbers is </p>
<div id="a0000011928" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000011929"></a>
<p> and the average of the numbers is <span></span>
. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000011930"></a>
<p>The numbers are essentially in order, with the numbers in each row going from least to greatest, and the numbers in each row all less than those in any lower row on the chart. So, we can easily scan through the list to find the middle number. There are thirty numbers total, so (since 30 is even) we must find the middle two numbers to compute the median, and the middle two are the <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 scores. There are 3 scores on the first row and 5 on the second, for a total of 8 scores less than 70. We therefore want the seventh and eighth scores in the 70s row, which are 76 and 77. The median is the average of these, which is 76.5. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000011931"></a>
<p>The mode is the score that occurs most. The string of 2s in the 70s row is easy to spot for the most common score, so 72 is the mode. </p><a name="a0000011932"></a>

<p>The bar chart is shown at the right. The chart displays counts of how many times each of the options occurs. Such a chart is sometimes called a <span class="def">histogram</span>. Notice that it is very similar to the stem-and-leaf plot. (We drew the bars horizontally rather than vertically in part to highlight this resemblance.) The lengths of the bars in the bar chart correspond to the lengths of the rows in the stem-and-leaf plot. This feature of stem-and-leaf plots allows them to be used in much the same manner as bar charts. For example, we can tell at a glance that many more students scored in the 70s than in the 90s. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000011934"></a>
<p>We can’t use the bar chart from part (d) to answer the questions in the first three parts. The stem-and-leaf plot allows us to keep all the values in the original data, while the grouping we did for the bar chart loses all the exact scores. The bar chart tells us what 10-point range each score is in, but doesn’t tell us exactly what the scores are. This can give us a sense for the median and the average, but cannot tell us exactly what they are. </p></li>

 Pie charts are particularly good for displaying the portion of the total that each quantity is. Bar charts, on the other hand, are not as good at showing this information. To compare our pie chart to a bar chart, let’s make a bar chart for the totals in Problem <a href="sect0075.html#problem:hairy">15</a>. We already know that 36 people chose cat-hair and 117 chose sawdust. We can use the first method in our solution above to compute the totals for the other favorite pie options. We find that <span></span>
 people chose pickle, <span></span>
 chose gasoline, and <span></span>
 chose lint. These are shown in the bar chart on the right. </p><a name="a0000011960"></a>
<p>Both the bar chart and the original pie chart allow us to compare different options quickly. For example, we can quickly see that pickle is the winner, and about the same number of people chose gasoline as chose cat-hair. But the pie chart allows us to see more quickly what portion of the total chose each option. For example, it’s very easy to see on the pie chart that around a quarter of the people chose sawdust pie. This isn’t as clear in the bar chart. </p><a name="a0000011961"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic"><img alt="\rightpic{stats_17.pdf}" align="bottom">
</div>

 The bar chart does have the advantage of allowing us to see the number of people who chose each option. The actual number of people is not reflected in the original pie chart. We could include this information on the pie chart if we like, as shown at the right. The sizes of the pieces in the pie chart still give us a sense of what portion of the whole each option is. </p><a name="a0000011962"></a>
