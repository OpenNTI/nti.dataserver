<div probnum="18" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000005984"></a>
<p>Seven more than twice what number equals thirty-five? </p></div>
<div id="a0000005986" class="solution">Solution for Problem 18:</div>
<span><a name="a0000005987"></a>
<p> The first step in turning many word problems into math is assigning a variable to an unknown quantity. Here, we let <span class="mathname">x</span> be the unknown number. Now, we can rewrite the problem as </p>
<blockquote class="quote"> <em>Seven more than twice <span class="mathname">x</span> equals thirty-five.</em> </blockquote><a name="a0000005989"></a>
<p> We can write “Seven more than twice <span class="mathname">x</span>” as <span></span>
, so we can rewrite the problem as </p>
<blockquote class="quote"> <em><span></span>
 equals thirty-five.</em> </blockquote><a name="a0000005991"></a>
<p> Now, it’s clear how to write this as an equation: </p>
<div id="a0000005993" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000005994"></a>
<p> Subtracting 7 from both sides gives <span></span>
, and dividing both sides by 2 gives <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000005995"></a>
<p>Checking our answer, we see that seven more than twice 14 does indeed equal 35. Therefore, the desired number is 14. </p></span>
<div probnum="19" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000005997"></a>
<p>Six plus half of a number equals four plus one-third of the same number. What is the number? </p></div>
<div id="a0000005999" class="solution">Solution for Problem 19:</div>
<span><a name="a0000006000"></a>
<p> We again start by assigning a variable, <span class="mathname">x</span>, to the unknown number. This makes our problem: </p>
<blockquote class="quote"> <em>Six plus half of <span class="mathname">x</span> equals four plus one-third of <span class="mathname">x</span>.</em> </blockquote><a name="a0000006002"></a>
<p> Converting this sentence into an equation gives </p>
<div id="a0000006004" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006005"></a>
<p> Subtracting <span></span>
 from both sides gives </p>
<div id="a0000006007" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006008"></a>
<p> so <span></span>
. Subtracting <span class="mathnumber">6</span> from both sides gives <span></span>
. Multiplying both sides by 6 gives <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000006009"></a>
<p>We finish by checking our answer. Six plus half of <span class="mathnumber">-12</span> equals 0. Four plus one-third of <span class="mathnumber">-12</span> also equals 0. So, the number is <span class="mathnumber">-12</span>. </p></span>
<div probnum="20" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000006011"></a>
<p>When you add 12 to a number and then divide the sum by <span class="mathnumber">13</span>, you get the same result as when you subtract <span class="mathnumber">13</span> from the number and then divide the difference by <span class="mathnumber">12</span>. What is the number? <span class="source">(Source: MATHCOUNTS)</span></p></div>

<span><a name="a0000006014"></a>
<p> Let’s mix it up a little bit. We’ll use <span class="mathname">n</span> for the number this time. We’ll also go straight from the words in the problem to the equation: </p>
<div id="a0000006016" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006017"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> When you write an equation to represent a problem, take a moment to check that your equation does correctly represent the problem before solving the equation. </div> </p><a name="a0000006018"></a>
<p>Multiplying both sides by 12 and by 13 to cancel the denominators gives </p>
<div id="a0000006020" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006021"></a>
<p> Expanding both sides gives </p>
<div id="a0000006023" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006024"></a>
<p> Subtracting <span></span>
 from both sides gives <span></span>
. Adding 169 to both sides gives <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000006025"></a>
<p>Checking our answer, we see that adding 12 to 313 and dividing the sum by 13 gives 25. Subtracting 13 from 313 and then dividing the difference by 12 also gives 25. So, the desired number is indeed 313. </p></span><a name="a0000006026"></a>
<p>Of course, you won’t often be confronted with problems written in terms of “a number” you must find. Instead, you’ll usually be seeking a more meaningful unknown quantity. </p>
<div probnum="21" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000006028"></a>
<p>My sister and I are buying a television for our room. Because I am older, I will pay <span></span>

<div id="a0000006030" class="solution">Solution for Problem 21:</div>
<span><a name="a0000006031"></a>
<p> We don’t know how much I pay or how much my sister pays. To which of these quantities should we assign a variable? </p><a name="a0000006032"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> When <a name="a0000006033" id="a0000006033"></a>assigning a variable in a problem with multiple unknown quantities, we usually assign the variable to the unknown quantity we care most about. </div> </p><a name="a0000006034"></a>
<p>We wish to know how much my sister pays, so let <span class="mathname">s</span> be the number of dollars she pays. We then express how much I pay in terms of my sister’s variable. </p><a name="a0000006035"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> We can often express multiple unknown quantities in terms of the same variable. </div> </p><a name="a0000006036"></a>
<p>Since I pay <span></span>
 more than my sister does, I must pay <span></span>
 dollars. Together, we spend <span></span>
, so we must have </p>
<div id="a0000006038" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006039"></a>
<p> Simplifying the left side gives <span></span>
. Subtracting 45 from both sides gives <span></span>
. Dividing both sides by 2 gives <span></span>
. Therefore, my sister pays <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000006040"></a>
<p>Checking our answer, I must pay <span></span>
. Combining this with the <span></span>
 my sister pays gives <span></span>
, as expected. </p></span><a name="a0000006041"></a>
<p>Sometimes it isn’t immediately obvious what quantity the variable should represent in a problem. </p>
<div probnum="22" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000006043"></a>
<p>I bought a new comic book at the Comic Book Shoppe and paid entirely using quarters. If I had instead paid using only dimes, I would have needed 9 more coins. How much did the comic book cost?<a name="prob:comicbook"></a> </p></div>
<div id="a0000006045" class="solution">Solution for Problem 22:</div>
<span><a name="a0000006046"></a>
<p> At first, it looks like we should assign a variable to the cost of the comic book. But it’s not immediately clear how we’d relate that to the information about the numbers of quarters and dimes. </p><a name="a0000006047"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> Sometimes you might not find a way to use your first choice for assigning a variable to make an equation. If assigning a variable to the quantity you seek doesn’t seem to work, try assigning a variable to a quantity you have information about. This is especially true when you can relate this quantity to what you seek. </div> </p><a name="a0000006048"></a>
<p>We know something about the number of quarters I paid. Also, if we find the number of quarters I paid, then we can figure out how much the comic book costs. So, let <span class="mathname">q</span> be the number of quarters I paid. In order to pay with dimes, I would have needed <span></span>
 dimes. Both <span class="mathname">q</span> quarters and <span></span>
 dimes must equal the price of the comic book. Since <span class="mathname">q</span> quarters is <span></span>
 cents, and <span></span>
 dimes is <span></span>
 cents, we must have </p>
<div id="a0000006050" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006051"></a>
<p> Expanding the right side gives <span></span>
. Subtracting <span></span>
 from both sides gives <span></span>
, and dividing by 15 gives <span></span>
. Therefore, I paid 6 quarters for the comic book, which means the comic book cost <span></span>
. To check our answer, we note that <span></span>
 dimes is also <span></span>
. </p></span>
<div probnum="23" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000006053"></a>
<p>A garage has 17 cars and motorcycles. Altogether, there are 56 wheels. How many of each type of vehicle are there? </p></div>
<div id="a0000006055" class="solution">Solution for Problem 23:</div>
<span><a name="a0000006056"></a>
<p> Let <span class="mathname">c</span> be the number of cars. Since there are 17 cars and motorcycles total, there are <span></span>
 motorcycles. Since each car has 4 wheels and each motorcycle has 2 wheels, the total number of wheels is <span></span>
. Therefore, we must have </p>
<div id="a0000006058" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006059"></a>
<p> Expanding the product on the left gives <span></span>
, and simplifying gives <span></span>
. Subtracting 34 from both sides gives <span></span>
, so <span></span>
. This means that there are 11 cars and <span></span>
 motorcycles. Checking, we find that 11 cars and 6 motorcycles together have <span></span>
 wheels. </p><a name="a0000006060"></a>
<p>We also might have solved this problem with a little clever insight. If all 17 vehicles were motorcycles, then there are <span></span>
 wheels total. That’s <span></span>
 wheels too few! Each time we replace a motorcycle with a car, the number of wheels increases by 2. So, if we start with 17 motorcycles, which together have 22 wheels too few, then we need to replace <span></span>
 motorcycles with 11 cars in order to have 56 wheels total. </p></span>

</div> </div> </p><a name="a0000006068"></a>
<p>We set the equation up incorrectly. The problem tells us that </p>
<div id="a0000006070" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006071"></a>
<p> Since my age three years ago is <span></span>

<div id="a0000006073" class="math equation">
<div></div>

<p> Multiplying both sides by 3 gives <span></span>
. Expanding both sides gives <span></span>

 from both sides gives <span></span>
, and adding 9 to both sides gives <span></span>
. Therefore, I’m 25 years old now. </p><a name="a0000006075"></a>
<p>Checking, we see that three years ago I was 22, and eight years from now I’ll be 33. Since <span></span>
, our answer is correct. </p></span><a name="a0000006076"></a>
<p>In our Bogus Solution to Problem <a href="sec-wordproblems.html#prob:bogggus">24</a>, we started with the equation <span></span>
. Suppose we hadn’t realized that we wrote the wrong equation, and proceeded to solve the equation. Multiplying both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction gives </p>
<div id="a0000006078" class="math equation">

</div><a name="a0000006079"></a>
<p> so <span></span>

<p>In slurfball, a fizzle is worth 2 points and a globbo is worth 5 points. Kumquare and the Wazzits recently played for the Intergalactic Slurfball Championship. During the game, Kumquare scored eight more fizzles than the Wazzits, but scored five fewer globbos than the Wazzits. Together the two teams scored 93 points total.

<div id="a0000006084" class="solution">Solution for Problem 25:</div>
<span><a name="a0000006085"></a>
<p> Once again, it isn’t obvious what quantity a variable should represent. We do know that the two teams together scored 93 points. So, if we let Kumquare’s score be <span class="mathname">k</span>, then the Wazzits’ score was <span></span>
. But how will we build an equation? </p><a name="a0000006086"></a>
<p>What else do we know about the scores of the teams? Kumquare scored eight more fizzles, which is <span></span>
 points, than the Wazzits. But Kumquare scored five fewer globbos, which is <span></span>
 points, than the Wazzits. So, altogether, Kumquare scored 9 fewer points than the Wazzits. Since Kumquare scored <span class="mathname">k</span> points, the Wazzits’ scored <span></span>
 points. We now have two expressions for the same quantity, the Wazzits’ score, so we can write an equation setting these expressions equal: </p>
<div id="a0000006088" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000006089"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> If you find two different expressions that represent the same quantity, then you have an equation. </div> </p><a name="a0000006090"></a>
<p>Adding <span class="mathname">k</span> and subtracting 9 from both sides of <span></span>

. Dividing by 2 gives <span></span>
