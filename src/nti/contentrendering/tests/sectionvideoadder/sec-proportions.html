<p>Whenever we have two ratios that are equal, we have a <span class="def">proportion</span>. The most common usage of proportion is when we have two changing quantities that are related in such a way that their ratio doesn’t change. </p><a name="a0000007678"></a>
<p>For example, suppose that Mario’s secret recipe for chocolate milk uses 8 ounces of milk and 2 ounces of chocolate syrup, and produces a 10-ounce glass of chocolate milk. The ratio of milk to chocolate syrup is <span></span>
, or <span></span>
. If Mario wants to make a big pitcher of chocolate milk for 6 people, then he will need <span></span>
 ounces of milk and <span></span>
 ounces of chocolate syrup, so the ratio of milk to chocolate syrup is <span></span>
, which is still <span></span>
. No matter what quantity of chocolate milk that we want, the ratio of milk to chocolate syrup will always be <span></span>
. We say that the milk and chocolate syrup are <span class="def">proportional</span> or <span class="def">in proportion</span>. </p><div id="a0000007679" class="section-problems"><span class="headingtext">Section Problems</span></div>

<p> Since <span></span>

, the ratio between an equal amount of dollars and euros is <span></span>
, which simplifies to <span></span>
. We let <span class="mathname">x</span> be the number of dollars that equals <span></span>
, which is what we want to find. Then as a proportion we have </p>
<div id="a0000007693" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007694"></a>
<p> which gives <span></span>
. We can solve for <span class="mathname">x</span> as <span></span>

<p>A recipe calls for <span></span>
 cups of flour and 4 eggs. If only 3 eggs are used, then how many cups of flour should be used? <span class="source">(Source: MATHCOUNTS)</span></p></div>
<div id="a0000007698" class="solution">Solution for Problem 12:</div>
<span><a name="a0000007699"></a>
<p> There are two primary methods we can use. </p><a name="a0000007700"></a>
<p><em>Method 1: Set up a proportion by equating ratios.</em> Because the recipe calls for <span></span>
 cups of flour and 4 eggs, we know that the ratio of flour to eggs should always equal <span></span>
. If we only have 3 eggs, then we need an amount of flour so that the ratio of flour to eggs still equals <span></span>
. This means that if we have <span class="mathname">x</span> cups of flour to go with our 3 eggs, we must have </p>
<div id="a0000007702" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007703"></a>
<p> We solve this by writing the equation with fractions: </p>
<div id="a0000007705" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007706"></a>
<p> Multiplying both sides of this equation by <span class="mathnumber">12</span> gives <span></span>
. So <span></span>
, and dividing by 4 gives <span></span>
. Therefore we need <span></span>
 cups of flour. </p><a name="a0000007707"></a>
<p><em>Method 2: Scale the quantities.</em> Because we only have 3 eggs and the recipe calls for 4 eggs, we are only using <span></span>
 of the recipe amount. In order for the ratio of flour to eggs to remain constant, we also need to use <span></span>
 of the recipe amount of flour. Therefore, the amount of flour that we need is </p>
<div id="a0000007709" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007710"></a>
<p> cups. </p></span><a name="a0000007711"></a>
<p>In the next problem, we use the geometric fact that at any given time, the length of an object is proportional to the length of its shadow. (This is based on the geometric concept of <span class="def">similarity</span>, which you will learn when you take a geometry course.) </p>
<div probnum="13" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000007713"></a>
<p>Sadie is 3 feet tall and at 6 p.m. in Sunnytown, Sadie casts an 8-foot shadow. Nick is 5 feet tall. How long is his shadow at 6 p.m. in Sunnytown? </p></div>
<div id="a0000007715" class="solution">Solution for Problem 13:</div>
<span><a name="a0000007716"></a>
<p> The information about Sadie tells us that the length of an object (or person) and the length of its shadow are proportional in the ratio <span></span>
. If Nick’s shadow has length <span class="mathname">x</span>, then the ratio <span></span>
 must equal the ratio <span></span>
. Therefore, <span></span>
, and multiplying both sides by <span></span>
 gives <span></span>
, so <span></span>
. Thus, Nick’s shadow is <span></span>
 feet long. </p></span>
<div probnum="14" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000007718"></a>
<p>My map of upstate New York has the scale <span></span>
. If Buffalo and Albany are 13 inches apart on my map, then how far apart are the cities? </p></div>
<div id="a0000007720" class="solution">Solution for Problem 14:</div>
<span><a name="a0000007721"></a>
<p> A map’s scale is another example of a proportion—it tells us that the ratio of the distance on the map to the distance in the real world is constant. For my map, this ratio is </p>
<div id="a0000007723" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007724"></a>
<p> Multiplying by 4 simplifies this ratio to <span></span>
, so that 1 inch on the map corresponds to 20 miles in real life. Thus, the 13 inches on the map between Buffalo and Albany means that the cities are <span></span>
 miles apart. </p></span>

<p>Sylvia is an architect designing a new building. The building will be 30 feet tall, and the windows will each be 8 feet high. Sylvia draws blueprints for the building on which the building is 8 inches tall. How tall are the windows on Sylvia’s blueprints? </p></div>
<div id="a0000007728" class="solution">Solution for Problem 15:</div>
<span><a name="a0000007729"></a>
<p> We start with the ratio </p>
<div id="a0000007731" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007732"></a>
<p> Thus, on the blueprints, we must have the same ratio between the heights of the building and the window. So if the window height on the blueprints is <span class="mathname">x</span> inches, then we have </p>
<div id="a0000007734" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007735"></a>
<p> so that <span></span>
. Multiplying both sides of this equation by <span></span>
 gives <span></span>
, so <span></span>
. Therefore, the windows are <span></span>
 inches tall on the blueprints. </p></span>
<div probnum="16" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000007737"></a>
<p>My wallet-size photo of my pet cat Snookums is 3 cm wide and 5 cm tall. If I want a larger photo to put on my wall, and I want the area of the photo to be 135 square centimeters, then how many centimeters wide should the larger photo be? </p></div>
<div id="a0000007739" class="solution">Solution for Problem 16:</div>
<span><a name="a0000007740"></a>
<p> The assumption in this problem is that no matter what the size, the picture will always have the same shape. More precisely, this means that the ratio of width to height will remain constant. Since the wallet-size photo has width 3 cm and height 5 cm, the ratio of width to height will always be <span></span>
. But we’re given neither the width nor the height of the larger photo: we’re only given the area. So how do we set up a proportion? </p><a name="a0000007741"></a>
<p>The proportion tells us that the width is <span></span>
 cm and the height is <span></span>
 cm for some number <span class="mathname">x</span>. This means that the area is <span></span>
 square centimeters. If I want a larger photo with area 135 square centimeters, then we must have <span></span>
, or <span></span>
. Therefore, <span></span>
. So my larger photo will be <span></span>
 cm wide (and <span></span>
 cm high). </p></span><div id="a0000007742" class="exercises"><span class="headingtext">Exercises</span></div>
