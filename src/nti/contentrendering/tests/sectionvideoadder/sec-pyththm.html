<p> A common mistake when using the Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse length of a right triangle is forgetting that the hypotenuse is squared in the equation, too. One quick way to avoid this error is to consider the three side lengths after finding the hypotenuse. </p><a name="a0000010882"></a>
<p>For example, suppose a right triangle has legs of lengths 3 and 4. The hypotenuse clearly can’t be <span></span>

<div id="a0000010886" class="solution">Solution for Problem 4:</div>
<span><a name="a0000010887"></a>
<p> Yes. The square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the legs. The sum of any two positive numbers is greater than both of the numbers being added. So, the square of the hypotenuse must be greater than the square of each leg. Therefore, the hypotenuse must be longer than each leg. </p></span>

<p>In Problems <a href="sec-pyththm.html#prob:Pythagintro">1</a> and <a href="sec-pyththm.html#prob:findthemissinglength">3</a>, we have seen two right triangles in which all three side lengths are integers.

<div id="a0000010894" class="math equation">

</div><a name="a0000010895"></a>
<p> Then, we look for pairs of squares that add up to another square. We immediately see <span></span>
, which is <span></span>
. We already saw this example in Problem <a href="sec-pyththm.html#prob:Pythagintro">1</a>. We also see <span></span>
, which is <span></span>
. So, a right triangle with legs of lengths 5 and 12 has a hypotenuse with length 13. We also find <span></span>

<p>The legs have lengths <span class="mathnumber">6033</span> and <span class="mathnumber">8044</span>. Um, squaring those doesn’t look like much fun. Let’s see if we can find a more clever way to solve this problem. We know that a right triangle with legs 3 and 4 has hypotenuse 5. In part (a), we saw that if the legs of a right triangle are <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, then the hypotenuse is <span></span>
. In part (b), we saw that if the legs of a right triangle are <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, then the hypotenuse is <span></span>
. It looks like there’s a pattern! </p><a name="a0000010920"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> Searching for patterns is a powerful problem-solving strategy. </div> </p><a name="a0000010921"></a>
<p>It appears that if the legs of a right triangle are <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, then the hypotenuse is <span></span>
. We can test this guess with the Pythagorean Theorem. Suppose the legs of a right triangle are <span></span>
 and <span></span>
. Then, the sum of the squares of the legs is </p>

</div><a name="a0000010927"></a>
<p> we have <span></span>
, which means that the length of the hypotenuse is indeed <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000010928"></a>
<p>This means that we don’t have to square 6033 and 8044! A right triangle with legs of lengths <span></span>
 and <span></span>
 has a hypotenuse with length <span></span>
. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000010929"></a>
<p>There’s nothing in our explanation in part (c) that requires <span class="mathname">x</span> to be a whole number; it can be a fraction, too! So, in a right triangle with legs of length <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, the hypotenuse has length <span></span>
. </p></li>

<p>Our work in Problem <a href="sec-pyththm.html#prob:ocmmonPyth">4</a> is an example of why knowing common Pythagorean triples is useful. Any time we have a right triangle in which the legs have ratio <span></span>
, then we know that all three sides of the triangle are in the ratio <span></span>
. As we saw in the final two parts of Problem <a href="sec-pyththm.html#prob:ocmmonPyth">4</a>, this can allow us to find the hypotenuse quickly without using the Pythagorean Theorem directly. </p><a name="a0000010931"></a>
<p>We can also sometimes use this approach to quickly find the length of a leg when we know the lengths of the other leg and the hypotenuse. </p>
<div probnum="7" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000010933"></a>
<p>The length of one leg of a right triangle is 210 and the triangle’s hypotenuse has length 750. What is the length of the other leg? </p></div>
<div id="a0000010935" class="solution">Solution for Problem 7:</div>
<span><a name="a0000010936"></a>
<p> We find the ratio of the given leg length to the hypotenuse length, hoping it will match the corresponding ratio in one of the Pythagorean triples we know. We have <span></span>
, so the ratio of the given leg to the hypotenuse is <span></span>
. This reminds us of the <span></span>
 Pythagorean triple that we saw in Problem <a href="sec-pyththm.html#prob:findthemissinglength">3</a>. Since the ratio of the known leg to the hypotenuse is <span></span>
, we know that all three sides are in the ratio <span></span>
. The first leg is <span></span>
 and the hypotenuse is <span></span>
, so the other leg of the right triangle is <span></span>
. </p></span><a name="a0000010937"></a>
<p><div class="important"> If we multiply all three side lengths of a right triangle by the same positive number, then the three new side lengths also satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem. In other words, if side lengths <span class="mathname">a</span>, <span class="mathname">b</span>, and <span class="mathname">c</span> satisfy <span></span>
