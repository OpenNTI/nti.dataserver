<a name="a0000011476"></a>
<p><a name="a0000011477" id="a0000011477"></a><a name="a0000011478" id="a0000011478"></a> </p><a name="a0000011479"></a>
<p>One way to provide information about a list of numbers is to use a single number to describe some feature of the numbers in the list. Here are three basic ways to choose that representative value. </p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li><a name="a0000011481"></a>
<p><span class="def">Average</span>: The average of a group of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers in the group. For example, the average of 3, 5, 6, and 10 is <span></span>
, which equals 6. The average is also called the <span class="def">mean</span> or the <span class="def">arithmetic mean</span>. </p><a name="a0000011482"></a>
<p>We sometimes use the word “average” as a verb. For example, we may say that a basketball player averages 23 points per game. This means that the average of the player’s point totals from all of her games is 23. An alternative way of saying this is that 23 is the player’s average point total “over” all of her games. </p></li><li><a name="a0000011483"></a>
<p><span class="def">Median</span>: If we list a group of numbers from least to greatest, the median of the group is the number in the middle. So, the median of the numbers in the list </p>
<div id="a0000011485" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000011486"></a>
<p> is 7. If there is an even number of numbers in the group, then the median is the average of the middle two numbers. For example, the median of the list </p>
<div id="a0000011488" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000011489"></a>
<p> is the average of <span class="mathnumber">5</span> and <span class="mathnumber">7</span>, which is <span></span>
. </p></li><li><a name="a0000011490"></a>
<p><a name="a0000011491" id="a0000011491"></a><span class="def">Mode</span>: The mode of a group of numbers is the number that appears most frequently in the group. So, the mode of </p>
<div id="a0000011493" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000011494"></a>
<p> is 3. A group can have multiple modes if there are multiple numbers that appear the same number of times. (We won’t discuss mode very much because it’s not as useful as average or median.) </p></li>
</ul><a name="a0000011495"></a>
<p><div class="important"> When determining the average, median, or mode of a group of numbers, the order of the numbers in the group is not important. For example, the average of the list <span></span>
 and the average of the list <span></span>
 are the same (they’re both 8), and the medians are the same too (they’re both 9). </div> </p><a name="a0000011496"></a>
<p>Average, median, and mode are examples of statistics. As you continue your study of math and science (and, indeed, any subject in which data is important), you’ll learn about many more types of statistics. </p><a name="a0000011497"></a>
<p><div class="sidebar"> Another statistic that you’ll sometimes see is <span class="def">range</span>. The range of a group of numbers is the difference between the greatest number and the least number. For example, the range of the list <span></span>
 is <span></span>
. </div> </p><a name="a0000011498"></a>
<p><div class="warning"> Some textbooks and reference books refer to mean, median, and mode all as “averages.” In day-to-day usage, the term “average” nearly always refers to the mean, so we have adopted this common usage of the term “average” in this text. </div> </p><div id="a0000011499" class="section-problems"><span class="headingtext">Section Problems</span></div>

<span>
<ol class="parts itemize">
	<li class="part"><a name="a0000011561"></a>
<p>Here are two solutions: </p><a name="a0000011562"></a>
<p><em>Solution 1: Assign a variable to the fifth score.</em> We let <span class="mathname">x</span> be Homer’s score in the fifth game. Then, the average of the five scores is </p>
<div id="a0000011564" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000011565"></a>
<p> Simplifying this gives <span></span>
. We’d like this to equal 190, so we have the equation </p>
<div id="a0000011567" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000011568"></a>
<p> We multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction, giving us <span></span>
. Subtracting 734 from both sides gives <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000011569"></a>
<p><em>Solution 2: Consider the sum of the 5 scores.</em> We can skip all the algebra of our first solution and jump straight to the last step. If the average of the 5 scores is 190, then the sum of the 5 scores must be <span></span>
, which equals 950. So, to figure out what Homer needs in his fifth game, we simply subtract the first four scores from 950: </p>
<div id="a0000011571" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000011572"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> The average of a list of numbers gives us information about the sum of the numbers in the list. Therefore, we can solve many problems about averages by thinking about sums. </div> </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000011573"></a>
<p>We start by listing the first four scores in order: </p>
<div id="a0000011575" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000011576"></a>
<p> After we add a new score to the list, the median score will be the score in the middle of the ordered list. If the new score is greater than 184, then the new score will be after 184 in the ordered list, making 184 the middle number in the list. This would make 184 the median score. If the new score is not greater than 184, then 184 will be the fourth score in the ordered list. This would mean that the median is no greater than 184. Therefore, it’s impossible for Homer to raise his median to 190. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000011577"></a>
<p>The previous part might make us wonder what values are possible for the median score. As noted, if the new score is greater than 184, then 184 is the median. Similarly, if the new score is less than 173, then 173 will be the middle score, and hence 173 will be the median. If the new score is between 173 and 184 (or equal to either), then that new score will be the median. Therefore, the median of the five scores can be any integer from 173 to 184, including 173 and 184. </p></li>

<p>There are four people whose heights are greater than the average, and their heights in inches are 56, 56, 57, 55. Subtracting 54.5 from each of these numbers gives 1.5, 1.5, 2.5, 0.5, and adding these differences gives <span></span>
. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000011594"></a>
<p>There are six people whose heights are less than the average, and their heights in inches are 53, 54, 53, 53, 54, 54. Subtracting each of these numbers from 54.5 gives 1.5, 0.5, 1.5, 1.5, 0.5, 0.5. Adding these differences gives <span></span>
. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000011595"></a>
<p>Our answers for parts (b) and (c) are the same! That is, the total difference between the 4 above-average heights and the average heights equals the total difference between the average height and the 6 below-average heights. Let’s see if this is just a coincidence. </p><a name="a0000011596"></a>
<p>We take a look at how much we have to change each student’s height to make that student’s height equal to the average height: </p><a name="a0000011597"></a>

</div><a name="a0000011599"></a>
<p>The sum of the original heights divided by 10 equals the average, so the sum of the original heights is 10 times the average, or 545. Each new height equals the average height, so the sum of the new heights is also 10 times the average, or 545. Therefore, the sum of all of the heights doesn’t change when we make everyone’s height equal to the original average. This means the sum of all of our changes must be 0! So, the total amount that we decrease the above-average heights must equal the total amount that we increase the below-average heights. </p></li>

<p>Parts (b)–(d) of Problem <a href="sect0074.html#prob:statsheights">3</a> gives us a new way to think about the average of a list of numbers: </p><a name="a0000011601"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> We can think of the average of a list of numbers as the number that makes the list <span class="def">balance</span>. This means that: <div id="a0000011602" class="math equation">
<img alt="\[  \left( \text{ \begin{minipage}{2in} \begin{center}  the sum of the amounts by which below-average numbers are less than the average \end{center} \end{minipage} } \right) = \left( \text{ \begin{minipage}{2in} \begin{center}  the sum of the amounts by which above-average numbers are greater than the average \end{center} \end{minipage} } \right)  \]" align="bottom">



</div> </div> </p><a name="a0000011603"></a>
<p>We saw this concept in Problem <a href="sect0074.html#prob:statsheights">3</a>. In part (b), we computed the sum of the amounts by which the above-average heights in the list were greater than the average, and it was 6. In part (c), we computed the sum of the amounts by which the below-average heights in the list were less than the average, and again it was 6. The average of <span class="mathnumber">54.5</span> was the number that “balanced” all of the heights in the list. </p><a name="a0000011604"></a>
<p>Let’s put this new way of thinking about average to work in a problem. </p>
<div probnum="4" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000011606"></a>
<p>Suppose you average 82 on your first 7 tests in a class. What must you score on the eighth test to raise your average to 84? <a name="prob:distfrommean"></a> </p></div>
<div id="a0000011608" class="solution">Solution for Problem 4:</div>
<span><a name="a0000011609"></a>
<p> <em>Solution 1: Consider the sum of all the tests.</em> In order to have an average of 84 after 8 tests, the sum of the 8 test scores must be <span></span>
. The first 7 tests have an average of 82, so the sum of the first 7 scores is <span></span>
. Therefore, the eighth score must be <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000011610"></a>
<p><em>Solution 2: Compare each test to the average, and balance.</em> If we replace each of the first 7 scores with the average score of 82, then we don’t change the sum of the first 7 scores. (This is the same idea as what we did in part (d) of Problem <a href="sect0074.html#prob:statsheights">3</a>.) We also don’t change the sum of the first 8 scores, no matter what the eighth score is. Therefore, changing the first 7 scores to 82 doesn’t change the average of the first 8 scores, either. </p><a name="a0000011611"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> The average of a list of numbers only depends on the number of items in the list and the sum of the items in the list. Therefore, if we change all of the items in the list to be equal to the list’s average, then we don’t change the average of the list. </div> </p><a name="a0000011612"></a>
<p>We need an eighth score that makes the average of seven 82’s and the eighth score equal to 84. To find that eighth score, we compare each score to the average score, keeping in mind that the new average of 84 must “balance” the eight scores. Each of the seven 82’s is 2 fewer than the average 84, so their total amount less than the average is <span></span>
. Therefore, in order for the average to balance the scores, the new <span></span>

<p>To find the average score for all 10 games, we first find the sum of the scores for all 10 games. Since the Sixers average 81 points in the first 6 games, they score a total of <span></span>
 points in the first 6 games. Similarly, they score <span></span>
 points in the next 4 games. So, the total number of points they score in the 10 games is </p>
<div id="a0000011623" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000011624"></a>
<p> Therefore the average score over these 10 games is <span></span>
 points. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000011625"></a>
<p>To make their average after 15 games equal 80, they must score a total of <span></span>
 points in the 15 games. In part (a), we saw that they scored 778 points in the first 10 games. So, in the final 5 games, they must score </p>
<div id="a0000011627" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000011628"></a>
<p> points. Therefore, their average score for the last 5 games must be <span></span>
 points. </p><a name="a0000011629"></a>
<p>We also could have used our balancing strategy from Problem <a href="sect0074.html#prob:distfrommean">4</a>. If the average after 15 games is 80 and the average for the first 10 games is 77.8, then the Sixers were 2.2 points per game below their 15-game average for the first 10 games. That’s a total of <span></span>
 points below average for the first 10 games. So, they have to be a total of 22 points above average for the last 5 games. That’s <span></span>
 points above average per game, so they have to average <span></span>
 points in the final five games. </p></li>

<p>The average is <span></span>

<p>After increasing the number of pieces in each bag, the numbers of pieces in the bags are 29, 31, 35, 37, and 38. Now the average number of pieces per bag is <span></span>
. So, after Mary adds 23 pieces to each bag, the average is 23 higher. This isn’t a coincidence. We can see why with some clever arithmetic. Rather than computing the number of candies in each bag after Mary adds 23 to each bag, we separate the additional candies in our computation of the average: </p>
<div id="a0000011643" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000011644"></a>
<p> Since <span></span>
 is the average before Mary adds candies, we see that the new average is simply 23 more than the old average. </p><a name="a0000011645"></a>
<p>We can follow the same steps to see that if Mary adds the same number of candies to each bag, then the average number of candies per bag increases by the amount she adds to each bag. <div class="important"> Suppose we have a list of numbers, and make a new list by adding the same number, <span class="mathname">n</span>, to each number in the original list.

<p>We notice that the numbers only differ in their final two digits. Each number is <span class="mathnumber">5647200</span> plus some two-digit number. Subtracting 5647200 from each number in the list gives </p>

<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000011649"></a>
<p> The average of these is <span></span>
. We now use the fact we discovered in the previous part. When we add 5647200 to each number in the list above, we recover the original list in the problem. Adding 5647200 to each number in a list increases the average of the list by 5647200. So, the desired average is <span></span>

<p>The mean of a set of five different positive integers is 15. The median is 18. What is the maximum possible value of the largest of these five integers? <span class="source">(Source: AMC 8)</span> </p></div>
<div id="a0000011653" class="solution">Solution for Problem 7:</div>
<span><a name="a0000011654"></a>
<p> Because there is an odd number of integers in the set, the middle number is the median. So, one number in the set is 18. Since the mean of the five integers is 15, the sum of the five numbers is <span></span>
, which equals 75. What’s wrong with this solution: <div class="bogus"> We know that one of the numbers is 18, which means the other four sum to <span></span>
. We want one of the numbers to be as large as possible, but they must all be positive, and they must all be different. So, we let the smallest three numbers be 1, 2, and 3. This leaves <span></span>
 for the largest number. </div> </p><a name="a0000011655"></a>
<p>We see that our solution is incorrect when we list the integers in order from least to greatest: 1, 2, 3, 18, 51. The median of this list is 3, not 18. </p><a name="a0000011656"></a>
<p>We correct our mistake by remembering that the median must be in the middle. So, there are two integers in the set greater than 18 and two less than 18. We want the largest integer to be as large as possible, so we make the other three integers (besides the largest and 18) as small as possible. We do this by letting the two less than 18 be 1 and 2, and letting one of the integers greater than 18 be 19. This leaves </p>
