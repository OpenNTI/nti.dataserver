<p>If a number is a divisor of both <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span>, then we say that the number is a <span class="def">common divisor</span> of <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span>. Common divisors are also referred to as <span class="def">common factors</span>. </p><a name="a0000003556"></a>
<p>For example, the divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30 (and their negations). The divisors of 96 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 96 (and their negations). The numbers in both lists are 1, 2, 3, and 6 (and their negations); these are the common divisors of 30 and 96. </p><a name="a0000003557"></a>
<p>The greatest positive integer that is a divisor of both <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span> is called the <span class="def">greatest common divisor</span> of <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span>. Among all the common divisors of 30 and 96, the largest is <span class="mathnumber">6</span>. So the greatest common divisor, or <span class="def">greatest common factor</span>, of 30 and <a name="a0000003558" id="a0000003558"></a>96 is <span class="mathnumber">6</span>. We sometimes shorten “greatest common divisor” to “<span></span>

<p>For example, in part (a) above, we wish to determine if <span></span>

<ul class="itemize">

<p>The exponent of <span class="mathnumber">2</span> in <span></span>

<p>The exponent of <span class="mathnumber">3</span> in <span></span>

</ul><a name="a0000003650"></a>
<p> Since each exponent in the prime factorization <span></span>

<div probnum="41" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000003652"></a>
<p>How can we use the prime factorizations of 360 and 48 to find <span></span>
? <a name="prob:primefactgcd"></a> </p></div>
<div id="a0000003654" class="solution">Solution for Problem 41:</div>
<span><a name="a0000003655"></a>
<p> The prime factorizations of 360 and 48 are </p>
<div id="a0000003657" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000003658"></a>
<p> The power of 2 in the prime factorization of a divisor of 360 cannot be greater than <span></span>
. The power of 2 in the prime factorization of a divisor of 48 cannot be greater than <span></span>
. To satisfy both of these conditions, the power of 2 in a common divisor of 360 and 48 is no greater than <span></span>
. So, the greatest power of 2 we can include in the prime factorization of <span></span>
 is <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000003659"></a>
<p>Similarly, the prime factorization of a divisor of 360 cannot have a power of 3 greater than <span></span>
, and the prime factorization of a divisor of 48 cannot have a power of 3 greater than <span></span>
. To satisfy both of these conditions, the greatest power of 3 we can include in the prime factorization of <span></span>
 is <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000003660"></a>
<p>Finally, a divisor of 48 cannot have 5 in its prime factorization, so the prime factorization of <span></span>
 cannot include 5. Similarly, the prime factorization of <span></span>
 cannot include any larger primes, since no primes besides 2 and 3 appear in the prime factorizations of both 360 and 48. </p><a name="a0000003661"></a>
<p>So, now we know that the prime factorization of <span></span>
 can only include the primes 2 and 3. The greatest power of <span class="mathnumber">2</span> the prime factorization can include is <span></span>
, while the greatest power of 3 it can include is <span></span>
. Looking back over our reasoning, we see how to use the prime factorizations of 360 and 48 to find the prime factorization of <span></span>
. We take the smallest power of each prime factor that appears in the prime factorizations of <em>both</em> 360 and 48. Below, the smallest power of each prime factor is in bold and underlined: </p>
<div id="a0000003663" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000003664"></a>
<p> We then combine these smallest powers to form <span></span>
: </p>
<div id="a0000003666" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000003667"></a>
<p> Notice that we don’t include a power of 5 in the prime factorization of <span></span>
. The prime factors of <span></span>
 are the primes that are prime factors of both 360 and 48. While 5 is a prime factor of 360, it is not a prime factor of 48, so 5 is not a prime factor of <span></span>
. </p></span><a name="a0000003668"></a>
<p>We can follow essentially the same process as in Problem <a href="sect0016.html#prob:primefactgcd">41</a> to find the greatest common divisor of any two numbers. </p><a name="a0000003669"></a>
<p><div class="important"><a name="a0000003670"></a>
<p> We can find the greatest common divisor of a group of numbers with the following process: </p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li value="1"><a name="a0000003672"></a>
<p>Find the prime factorization of each number. </p></li><li value="2"><a name="a0000003673"></a>
<p>Identify the primes that appear in <em>all</em> of the prime factorizations. </p></li><li value="3"><a name="a0000003674"></a>
<p>Among the prime factorizations, find the smallest power of each prime from Step 2. </p></li><li value="4"><a name="a0000003675"></a>
<p>Multiply the powers of primes found in Step 3. </p></li>
</ol></div> </p><a name="a0000003676"></a>
<p>But what happens if there aren’t any primes that appear in all of the prime factorizations? Then we can’t have any primes at all in the prime factorization of the greatest common divisor. This means that the greatest common divisor is 1. We say that two integers are <span class="def">relatively prime</span> if their greatest common divisor is <span class="mathnumber">1</span>. </p><a name="a0000003677"></a>

<div id="a0000003736" class="solution">Solution for Problem 44:</div>

<div id="a0000003739" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000003740"></a>
<p> Therefore, the number of bags and the number of candies in each bag are both divisors of 70. At first, we might think that the smallest number of bags Tony could grab is 1 bag, with 70 candies in it. But then we remember Kaya. There can’t possibly be 70 candies in each bag, since Kaya only has 42 candies. This means we must have </p>
<div id="a0000003742" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000003743"></a>
<p> Therefore, the number of candies in each bag must be a divisor of 42 as well. So, the number of candies in each bag is a common divisor of 42 and 70. Which common divisor is the number of candies in the bag that makes the number of bags Tony grabbed as small as possible? </p><a name="a0000003744"></a>
<p>We know that the number of bags Tony grabbed is 70 divided by the number of candies in each bag. So, the number of bags Tony grabbed is as small as possible when the number of candies in each bag is as large as possible. That means the number of candies in each bag must be the greatest common divisor of 42 and 70. </p><a name="a0000003745"></a>
<p>Since <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, we have <span></span>
. This means that the largest possible number of candies in each bag is 14. If there are 14 candies in each bag, then Tony must have <span></span>
 bags and Kaya must have <span></span>
 bags. So, the smallest possible number of bags Tony could have grabbed is 5. </p></span>

<p>Our work in the first two parts gives us a pretty good guide as to what’s going on. In part (a), the prime factorizations of 4 and 9 are <span></span>
 and <span></span>
. These have no prime factors in common, so 4 and 9 are relatively prime. (As a reminder, two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor is 1.) Moreover, both <span></span>

 must appear in the prime factorization of <span></span>

 is the product of 4 and 9. </p><a name="a0000003758"></a>
<p>In part (b), the prime factorizations of 10 and 27 are <span></span>
 and <span></span>
. Again, these have no prime factors in common, so 10 and 27 are relatively prime. Because the prime factorizations have no primes in common, we form the prime factorization of <span></span>

<p>Similarly, if <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span> are relatively prime, then their prime factorizations cannot share any prime factors. So, the prime factorization of <span></span>

<p>Yes. Every common multiple of 4 and 9 must be a multiple of the least common multiple of 4 and 9. Since <span></span>
, every multiple of both 4 and 9 is a multiple of 36. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000003770"></a>
<p>No. Since <span></span>
, every common multiple of 3 and 12 is a multiple of 12. But there are multiples of 12 that are not multiples of 36. For example, 12 itself is a multiple of both 3 and 12, but 12 is not a multiple of 36. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000003771"></a>
<p>We don’t yet have a divisibility rule for 36, but we do have rules for 4 and 9. In part (a), we saw that every common multiple of 4 and 9 is a multiple of 36. So, if we find <span class="mathname">A</span> such that <span></span>
 is divisible by both 4 and 9, then the resulting <span></span>
 must be divisible by 36. </p><a name="a0000003772"></a>
<p>Since <span></span>
 must be divisible by 9, the sum <span></span>
 must be divisible by 9. This sum equals <span></span>
, so the digit <span class="mathname">A</span> must be 0 or 9. In order for the number <span></span>
 to be divisible by 4, the number formed by its last two digits must be divisible by 4. Since 06 is not divisible by 4 but 96 is divisible by 4, the only possible value of <span class="mathname">A</span> is 9. Checking, we find that <span></span>

 is indeed divisible by 36. </p></li>

<p>The first two parts of Problem <a href="sect0016.html#prob:divbycomposite">3</a> exhibit an important fact about divisibility. To test for divisibility by 36, we can instead test for divisibility by 4 and by 9, since <span></span>
 and <span></span>
. However, we can’t test for divisibility by 36 through testing for divisibility by 3 and by 12, even though <span></span>
 as well. This is because <span></span>
, not 36. So, for example, <span></span>
 is a multiple of both 3 and 12, but 24 is not a multiple of 36. </p><a name="a0000003775"></a>
<p>Similarly, suppose <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span> are positive integers, and we want to be able to test if some other number is divisible by the product <span class="mathname">ab</span>. We can only perform this test by testing separately for divisibility by <span class="mathname">a</span> and by <span class="mathname">b</span> if <span></span>

Problem <a href="sect0016.html#prob:divbycomposite">3</a> gave us one example of this: we tested for divisibility by 36 through testing for divisibility by 4 and 9. Similarly, we can test for divisibility by 12 through testing for divisibility by 3 and 4, but not through testing by divisibility by 2 and 6 (since 2 and 6 aren’t relatively prime). </p><a name="a0000003776"></a>
