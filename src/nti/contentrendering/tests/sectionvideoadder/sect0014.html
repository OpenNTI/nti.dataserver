<p>When we <a name="a0000003023" id="a0000003023"></a><a name="a0000003024" id="a0000003024"></a><span class="def">factor</span> an integer, we write it as a product of integers. So, if a number is composite, then we can factor it by writing it as the product of two smaller integers. For example, we can factor 12 as <span></span>
. Since 6 is composite, we also can factor 6, writing it as the product of 2 and 3: </p>
<div id="a0000003026" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000003027"></a>
<p> Since 2 and 3 are prime, we cannot write either of them as the product of two smaller positive integers. We have expressed 12 as a product of primes. We call this the <span class="def">prime factorization</span> of 12. The primes that appear in the prime factorization of 12 are the <a name="a0000003028" id="a0000003028"></a><a name="a0000003029" id="a0000003029"></a><span class="def">prime factors</span> of 12. So, 2 and 3 are the prime factors of 12. </p><a name="a0000003030"></a>
<p>We usually write prime factorizations using powers. For example, the prime factorization of 12 is <span></span>
. Note that we write the primes in increasing order. In this chapter, we will often include exponents of 1, but usually these are left out elsewhere. </p><a name="a0000003031"></a>
<p>It’s easy to keep track of your work when finding the prime factorization of a small number like 12. When finding the prime factorization of a larger number, we sometimes use a <a name="a0000003032" id="a0000003032"></a><span class="def">factor tree</span> to organize our work. </p><a name="a0000003033"></a>

</div>

</div> We’ll build a sample factor tree for the prime factorization of 12. We start by writing 12. We can factor 12 as <span></span>
; we show this in the factor tree by splitting 12 into a 2 and a 6. We circle primes we encounter in the tree, so we circle the 2 as shown. We can’t factor primes into a product of smaller positive integers, so we know there won’t be any branches going downward from circled numbers. </p><a name="a0000003034"></a>
<p><div class="rightpic parpic"><div class="ntixymath"><img alt="$\xymatrix@=2.5pt@C=1pt@!{ &amp; 12\ar@ {-}[dl]\ar@ {-}[dr]\\*+[o][F]{2}&amp; &amp; 6\ar@ {-}[dl]\ar@ {-}[dr]\\ &amp; *+[o][F]{2}&amp; &amp; *+[o][F]{3}}$" align="bottom">
</div>

</div> Since 6 isn’t prime, we can factor it into the product of two smaller numbers, 2 and 3. Each of these are prime, so we circle both. There are no uncircled numbers left to factor, so we have our prime factorization. We can now easily read the prime factorization of 12 from our factor tree: </p>

</ol></span><a name="a0000003100"></a>
<p>Every positive integer has a prime factorization. We can see why by considering the primes, the composites, and 1 separately: </p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li><a name="a0000003102"></a>
<p><b class="bf">Primes</b>. The prime factorization of a prime number is simply the number itself. For example, the prime factorization of 5 is 5. </p></li><li><a name="a0000003103"></a>
<p><b class="bf">Composites</b>. We can look to our factor trees to explain why every composite number has a prime factorization. Any composite number can be written as the product of two smaller numbers. We then continue our tree-building process with these smaller positive numbers. For each number, we either identify the number as prime and circle it, or we break the number into a product of smaller positive integers. But we can’t continue this process forever, because we can’t keep producing smaller and smaller positive integers. So, we must reach a point at which we can’t continue the factor tree. At this point, all of the numbers at the ends of the factor tree must be prime, because they cannot be factored. This means we are guaranteed to find a prime factorization of any composite integer. </p></li><li><a name="a0000003104"></a>
<p><b class="bf">1</b>. We define the prime factorization of 1 to be simply 1. This isn’t a product of primes, but this definition does allow us to write statements about “prime factorizations of positive integers” without having to include “except 1” every time. </p></li>
</ul><a name="a0000003105"></a>
<p>Not only does every positive integer have a prime factorization, but the prime factorization of each number is unique. That is, for any positive integer besides 1, there is only one group of primes whose product equals the integer. (Note that we are disregarding the order of the primes in the prime factorization. So, <span></span>
 is the same prime factorization as <span></span>
.) This powerful result is called the <a name="a0000003106" id="a0000003106"></a><span class="def">Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</span>. We won’t prove this powerful theorem here, because the tools needed for the proof are too advanced for this book. </p><a name="a0000003107"></a>
<p><div class="important"> <b class="bf">Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</b>. Every positive integer has a unique prime factorization. </div> </p><a name="a0000003108"></a>
<p>As you become more experienced with primes and prime factorizations, you probably won’t use factor trees to find prime factorizations of many numbers. You’ll often be able to reason your way to a prime factorization without a tree. For example, to find the prime factorization of 30, you might reason as follows: </p>

<p> We’ll take this approach to finding the prime factorizations of numbers for the rest of this section. </p><a name="a0000003112"></a>

<p>All of the exponents in these prime factorizations are even. Our steps for finding the prime factorizations tell us why. In each part, we found the prime factorization of a square <span></span>
 by finding the prime factorization of <span class="mathname">n</span>, and then squaring the resulting prime factorization. When squaring, we multiply the exponent of each prime in the prime factorization of <span class="mathname">n</span> by 2. This makes the exponent of each prime in the prime factorization of <span></span>
 even. </p><a name="a0000003132"></a>
<p>We can run this logic in reverse, too! If we start with a prime factorization in which each exponent is even, then we can write that prime factorization as the square of another prime factorization whose exponents are half the exponents of the original prime factorization. For example, consider the prime factorization <span></span>
. We have </p>
<div id="a0000003134" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000003135"></a>
<p> so we see that <span></span>

So, neither of Paul’s integers can have both a 2 and a 5 in its prime factorization. This means that all the 2’s in Paul’s product <span></span>
 must come from one of his integers, and all of the 5’s come from the other integer. Therefore, the only two possible numbers that fit our problem are <span></span>
 and <span></span>
, which means that the sum of Paul’s integers is <span></span>
. </p></span><a name="a0000003159"></a>
<p>Now that we know that prime numbers are important, we might wonder how many primes there are. </p>

<ol class="parts itemize">

<p>The 10 smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. So, </p>
<div id="a0000003170" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000003171"></a>
<p> We see that <span></span>
 is 1 more than 2 times some integer, so <span></span>
 must be odd. Therefore, <span class="mathname">N</span> is not divisible by 2. </p><a name="a0000003172"></a>
<p>Similarly, <span></span>
 is 1 more than 3 times some integer, so <span></span>
 is not divisible by 3. Next, <span></span>
 is 1 more than 5 times some integer, so <span></span>
 is not divisible by 5. Continuing in this way, we see that <span></span>
 is 1 more than a multiple of each of the first 10 primes, so <span></span>
 is not divisible by any of the 10 smallest prime numbers. This means that the prime factorization of <span></span>
 doesn’t include any of these 10 smallest primes. That tells us that all of the prime factors of <span></span>
 are greater than 29. </p><a name="a0000003173"></a>
<p>For the record, the number <span></span>
 is <span class="mathnumber">6469693231</span>, and the prime factorization of this number is <span></span>
. (Yes, we used a computer to figure this out!) </p><a name="a0000003174"></a>
<p>Of course, we know already that there are more primes than just the smallest ten primes. Let’s see what this approach tells us if we start with more primes. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000003175"></a>
<p>It’ll take a long time to figure out the 100 smallest primes. Fortunately, we don’t have to. By the same argument as in part (a), if <span class="mathname">N</span> is the product of the 100 smallest primes, then <span></span>
 is not divisible by any of these primes. This is because <span class="mathname">N</span> is a multiple of each of these primes, so <span></span>
 divided by any one of these primes leaves a remainder of 1. </p><a name="a0000003176"></a>
<p>Since the prime factorization <span></span>
 cannot include any of the 100 smallest primes, it must consist of primes that are larger than these 100 smallest primes. As in part (a), this tells us that there must be some primes besides these 100 primes. </p><a name="a0000003177"></a>

<p> Just in case you’re curious, <span></span>

<p> Good luck finding the prime factorization of that, but at least you now know that you don’t have to check the first 100 primes! </p></div> </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000003181"></a>
<p>Suppose we made a finite list (meaning a list that ends) that we thought included all of the primes. If we let <span class="mathname">N</span> equal the product of all the numbers in the list, then <span class="mathname">N</span> is a multiple of all of the primes in our list. So, just as in parts (a) and (b), <span></span>
 is not a multiple of <em>any</em> of the primes in our list. That means that the prime factorization of <span></span>
 must have primes that aren’t in our list! No matter how long we make our list, this argument tells us that there will be other primes that are not on the list. So, it is impossible to make a finite list of all the primes. There are infinitely many prime numbers. </p></li>
