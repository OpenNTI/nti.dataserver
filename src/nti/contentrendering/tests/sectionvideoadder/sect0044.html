<p>A ratio is a handy gadget for comparing two quantities. But it’s also useful for comparing <em>more</em> than two quantities. For example, suppose a pet store has 4 dogs, 5 cats, and 11 goldfish. We would say that the numbers of dogs, cats, and goldfish are in the ratio of <span></span>
. Since 4, 5, and 11 have no common factors, we cannot simplify this ratio any further. If a different (more exotic) pet store had 9 geckos, 12 iguanas, and 21 snakes, then we would say that the numbers of geckos, iguanas, and snakes are in the ratio of <span></span>
. But now, since 3 is a common factor of 9, 12, and 21, we can divide each term of the ratio by 3, to say that the numbers of geckos, iguanas, and snakes are in the ratio of </p>

</div><a name="a0000007564"></a>
<p>Just as with a two-way ratio, a multi-way ratio only gives you information about the <em>relative</em> quantities of the items—it doesn’t tell you anything about the total number of items. For example, if you know that a third pet store has hamsters, guinea pigs, and rabbits in the ratio <span></span>
, all you know is that for every hamster, there are 2 guinea pigs and 5 rabbits. There might be 1 hamster, 2 guinea pigs, and 5 rabbits, or there might be 6 hamsters, 12 guinea pigs, and 30 rabbits; more generally, there are <span class="mathname">n</span> hamsters, <span></span>
 guinea pigs, and <span></span>
 rabbits for some number <span class="mathname">n</span>. </p><a name="a0000007565"></a>
<p>Although the multiple parts of a multi-way ratio may at first look confusing, they’re really not that much different from a two-way ratio, as we will see in the following problems. </p><div id="a0000007566" class="section-problems"><span class="headingtext">Section Problems</span></div>

<p>The greatest common factor of 5, 15, and 10 is 5, so we divide each part of the ratio by 5: </p>

<p>It is a little more difficult to see what the greatest common factor of 6, 10, and 9 is. We can get a little more insight by factoring each number: </p>
<div id="a0000007599" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007600"></a>
<p> Now we can see that there is no factor greater than 1 that is common to all three numbers, so the ratio <span></span>
 is already simplified. </p></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000007601"></a>

</div></li><li class="part"><a name="a0000007604"></a>
<p>We handle fractions a little bit differently: now we want to find a number we can multiply each term by so that each becomes a integer. This is usually the least common denominator of the fractions. In the ratio <span></span>

</div><a name="a0000007610"></a>

<p>Just as with a two-way ratio, we can think of a multi-way ratio in terms of “parts of the whole,” as in the next problem. </p>
<div probnum="7" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000007615"></a>
<p><a name="prob:bowlingratio"></a> A bowling tournament pays out prizes to the top 3 players in the ratio <span></span>
. If the total prize money is <span></span>
, then how much does the first-place winner receive? </p></div>
<div id="a0000007617" class="solution">Solution for Problem 7:</div>
<span><a name="a0000007618"></a>
<p> The <span></span>
 ratio means that for every <span></span>
 the winner gets, the second-place player gets <span></span>
 and the third-place player gets <span></span>
. In other words, for every <span></span>
 that the winner gets, a total of <span></span>
 is paid out. Therefore, the winner gets <span></span>
 of the total money paid out. Since the total prize money is <span></span>
, and the winner gets <span></span>
 of the total, he gets <span></span>
. </p></span><a name="a0000007619"></a>
<p>In Problem <a href="sect0044.html#prob:bowlingratio">7</a>, we saw that a ratio of <span></span>
 led to the first quantity being <span></span>
 of the whole. In the same way, the second-place winner gets <span></span>
 of the prize money, and the third-place winner gets <span></span>
 of the prize money. </p><a name="a0000007620"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> In a multi-part ratio, you can often think of each term as a “part of the whole.” That is, you add all the terms in the ratio to get the “whole,” and then each individual term makes up part of that whole. </div> </p><a name="a0000007621"></a>
<p><div class="warning"> Again, remember that ratio is a <em>relative</em> concept. The ratio only tells you the fraction of the whole that each part represents—it doesn’t tell you anything about how much the total or each part is. </div> </p><a name="a0000007622"></a>
<p>Going back to Problem <a href="sect0044.html#prob:bowlingratio">7</a>, the ratio itself only tells us that the first-place winner gets <span></span>
 of the money. The ratio doesn’t tell us exactly how much the winner gets. It is only with the additional information about the total prize money that we can compute the actual money the winner receives. </p>
<div probnum="8" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000007624"></a>
<p><a name="prob:ratiocake"></a> Sam wants to bake a cake that requires butter, flour, sugar, and milk in the ratio <span></span>
. Sam has <span></span>
 cup of sugar. How much of the other ingredients does he need? </p></div>
<div id="a0000007626" class="solution">Solution for Problem 8:</div>
<span><a name="a0000007627"></a>
<p> We’ll present three different methods for solving this problem. </p><a name="a0000007628"></a>
<p><em>Method 1: Convert the ratio to match the given quantity.</em> The given ratio of butter to flour to sugar to milk is <span></span>
. But we only have <span></span>
 cup of sugar, so we convert the ratio so that <span></span>
 appears in the “sugar” position. Since the given ratio has a 2 in that position, we need to divide each term of the ratio by 4: </p>
<div id="a0000007630" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007631"></a>
<p> Now we can just read from the ratio the quantities of the other ingredients that correspond to <span></span>
 cup of sugar: <span></span>
 cup of butter, <span></span>
 cup of flour, and <span></span>
 cup of milk. </p><a name="a0000007632"></a>
<p><em>Method 2: Use separate two-part ratios.</em> We can break up the multi-way ratio into several separate two-part ratios, where each ratio compares some ingredient to sugar. For example, the ratio of butter to sugar is <span></span>
—this is just a ratio consisting of the butter and sugar terms from the original 4-part ratio. </p><a name="a0000007633"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> We can remove terms from a multi-way ratio to get a simpler ratio that only compares some of the quantities from the original ratio. </div> </p><a name="a0000007634"></a>
<p>Since the butter and sugar are in ratio <span></span>
, we know that there is half as much butter as sugar. We have <span></span>
 cup of sugar, so the amount of butter is <span></span>
 cup. </p><a name="a0000007635"></a>
<p>Similarly, the ratio of flour to sugar is <span></span>
, so there is three times as much flour as sugar. Thus, since there is <span></span>
 cup of sugar, there are <span></span>
 cups of flour. Finally, the ratio of sugar to milk is <span></span>
, so there is <span></span>
 cup of milk. </p><a name="a0000007636"></a>
<p><em>Method 3: Compute the total.</em> We can use the “parts of the whole” way of thinking with our 4-part ratio. The sugar is <span></span>
 of the entire ingredients, and we have <span></span>
 cup of sugar. Thus the total quantity of ingredients is <span></span>
 cups. </p><a name="a0000007637"></a>
<p>Now we can use the “parts of the whole” to compute the other ingredient amounts. The butter is <span></span>
 of the whole, so there is <span></span>
 cup of butter. Next, the flour is <span></span>
 of the whole, so there are <span></span>
 cups of flour. Finally, the milk is <span></span>
 of the whole, so there is <span></span>
 cup of milk. </p></span><a name="a0000007638"></a>
<p><div class="concept"> None of the techniques from Problem <a href="sect0044.html#prob:ratiocake">8</a> are “right” or “wrong.” Ratios are best approached with flexible thinking. Ratios can be interpreted in many different ways, and you should use the method that you feel most comfortable with, or the method that appears to work best for the particular problem that you’re working on. </div> </p>

<div id="a0000007642" class="solution">Solution for Problem 9:</div>
<span><a name="a0000007643"></a>
<p> Since we are given the total amount and we want to find the amount of one of the parts, the “parts of the whole” method will probably work best. The given ratio is <span></span>
 of <span></span>
, and the total is 3 gallons. So the red paint is <span></span>
 of the whole, and thus Jamal needs <span></span>
 gallon of red paint. </p></span>

<p><a name="prob:blotsblits"></a> If three blots equal four bleets, and five bleets equal six blits, then what is the ratio of one blit to one blot? <span class="source">(Source: MATHCOUNTS)</span></p></div>
<div id="a0000007647" class="solution">Solution for Problem 10:</div>
<span><a name="a0000007648"></a>
<p> What is especially confusing about this problem—aside from the goofy, similar-sounding names—is that the word “equal” in the problem means equal values, not equal quantities. That is, “3 blots equal 4 bleets” means that the value of 3 blots is equal to the value of 4 bleets. </p><a name="a0000007649"></a>
<p>The first statement in this problem gives us the ratio of equal values of blots and bleets: the values are equal if the quantities are in the ratio <span></span>
. Similarly, bleets and blits have equal value if the quantities are in the ratio <span></span>
. We’d like to combine this pair of ratios into a single 3-way ratio, so that we can compare blots and blits. </p><a name="a0000007650"></a>
<p>Let’s make a little chart of our data so far: </p>
<div id="a0000007652" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007653"></a>
<p> We’d be able to compare blits and blots if the number of bleets in the above two ratios were equal. So let’s make them equal! We can do this by multiplying the parts of the first ratio by 5 and the parts of the second ratio by 4: </p>
<div id="a0000007655" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007656"></a>
<p> Aha—now we can write it as a 3-way ratio of blots to bleets to blits. </p>
<div id="a0000007658" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000007659"></a>
<p> The problem asked us for the relationship between blots and blits, and we can read this information from our 3-way ratio. We see that blots and blits are in the ratio <span></span>
, which can be simplified as </p>
