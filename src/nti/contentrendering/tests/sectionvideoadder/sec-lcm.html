<p>Suppose <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span> are positive integers. If a number is a multiple of both <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span>, then we say that the number is a <span class="def">common multiple</span> of <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span>. The smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span> is called the <span class="def">least common multiple</span> of <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span>. For example, 12 is a common multiple of 2 and 3, and the least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. </p><a name="a0000003215"></a>
<p>We can refer to the least common multiple of <span class="mathname">a</span> and <span class="mathname">b</span> as <a name="a0000003216" id="a0000003216"></a><span></span>

<p>When we multiply <span></span>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at how we can use the prime factorization of a positive integer <span class="mathname">n</span> to identify multiples of <span class="mathname">n</span>. We get a multiple of <span class="mathname">n</span> by multiplying <span class="mathname">n</span> by an integer. We can think of this as multiplying <span class="mathname">n</span>’s prime factorization by an integer. So, for example, if <span></span>
 appears in the prime factorization of <span class="mathname">n</span>, then 2 must be raised to at least the <span>3</span><sup>rd</sup> power in the prime factorization of any multiple of <span class="mathname">n</span>. </p><a name="a0000003306"></a>
<p>Similarly, the prime factorization of any multiple of <span class="mathname">n</span> includes the entire prime factorization of <span class="mathname">n</span>. That is, every prime in the prime factorization of <span class="mathname">n</span> is in the prime factorization of every multiple of <span class="mathname">n</span>, and is raised to at least as great a power in the multiple as it is in <span class="mathname">n</span>. </p><a name="a0000003307"></a>
<p>The numbers in parts (a) and (c) have 2 raised to at least the <span>3</span><sup>rd</sup> power and 3 raised to at least the <span>2</span><sup>nd</sup> power, so they are multiples of <span></span>

, and the number in part (d) doesn’t have a large enough power of 2. </p><a name="a0000003308"></a>
<p><div class="important"> Let <span class="mathname">n</span> be a positive integer.

<p>In part (c) of Problem <a href="sec-lcm.html#prob:startingmultspro">4</a>, we wish to test whether or not <span></span>
 is a multiple of <span></span>
. We look at each of the prime factors of <span></span>

<ul class="itemize">
<li><a name="a0000003311"></a>
<p>The exponent of <span class="mathnumber">2</span> in <span></span>
 (which is 4) is at least the exponent of <span></span>
 (which is 3). </p></li><li><a name="a0000003312"></a>
<p>The exponent of <span class="mathnumber">3</span> in <span></span>
 (which is 2) is at least the exponent of <span class="mathnumber">3</span> in <span></span>
 (which is also 2). </p></li>
</ul><a name="a0000003313"></a>
<p> Since each prime in the prime factorization <span></span>

<p>Now that we know how to identify multiples of a number using prime factorizations, let’s try finding the least common multiple of two numbers using prime factorizations. </p>
<div probnum="28" type="problem" class="problem"><a name="a0000003316"></a>
<p>How can we use the prime factorizations of 24 and 90 to find <span></span>

<div id="a0000003318" class="solution">Solution for Problem 28:</div>
<span><a name="a0000003319"></a>
<p> The prime factorizations of 24 and 90 are </p>
<div id="a0000003321" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000003322"></a>
<p> The power of 2 in the prime factorization of a multiple of 24 must be at least <span></span>
. The power of 2 in the prime factorization of a multiple of 90 must be at least <span></span>
. To satisfy both of these conditions, the power of 2 in a common multiple of 24 and 90 must be at least <span></span>
. So, the smallest power of 2 we can include in the prime factorization of <span></span>
 is <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000003323"></a>
<p>Similarly, the power of 3 in the prime factorization of a multiple of 24 must be at least <span></span>
, and the power of 3 in the prime factorization of a multiple of 90 must be at least <span></span>
. To satisfy both of these conditions, the smallest power of 3 we can include in the prime factorization of <span></span>
 is <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000003324"></a>
<p>Finally, we have <span class="mathnumber">5</span> raised to at least the <span>1</span><sup>st</sup> power in any multiple of 90, so we include <span></span>
 in the prime factorization of <span></span>
. </p><a name="a0000003325"></a>
<p>So, now we know that the prime factorization of <span></span>
 must include <span></span>
, <span></span>
, and <span></span>
. Looking back at our reasoning, we see how to use the prime factorizations of 24 and 90 to find the prime factorization of <span></span>
. We take the higher power of each prime factor that appears in the prime factorization of either 24 or 90. Below, the higher power of each prime factor is in bold and underlined: </p>
<div id="a0000003327" class="math equation">

: </p>
<div id="a0000003330" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000003331"></a>
<p>To check that 360 is indeed the least common multiple of 24 and 90, we can list the multiples of 90 up to 360: </p>
<div id="a0000003333" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000003334"></a>
<p> The first three numbers in this list are not also multiples of 24, while <span></span>
 is a multiple of 24. So, 360 is indeed the least common multiple of 24 and 90. </p></span><a name="a0000003335"></a>
<p>We can follow essentially the same process as in Problem <a href="sec-lcm.html#prob:primefactlcm">28</a> to find the least common multiple of any group of numbers. </p><a name="a0000003336"></a>
<p><div class="important"> To find the prime factorization of the least common multiple of a group of numbers, we first find the prime factorization of each number.

<p>Our explanation in Problem <a href="sec-lcm.html#prob:primefactlcm">28</a> not only tells us how to find the prime factorization of the least common multiple of 24 and 90.

<p> In each part, we use the prime factorizations of the numbers to construct the desired least common multiple. In each set of prime factorizations, we bold and underline the highest power of each prime. Note that if the highest power of a particular prime appears in both prime factorizations, then we only need to include it once in the prime factorization of the least common multiple. So, we’ll just bold and underline one of them. (You’ll see an example of this in part (b).) </p>

<p>Each of the prime factorizations of <span></span>

 has exponent one greater than the greatest power of 2 that appears in the prime factorization of either <span class="mathname">a</span> or <span class="mathname">b</span>. This tells us that the prime factorization of <span></span>

If they all ring their bells at noon on the same day, at what time will they next all ring their bells together? <span class="source">(Source: MATHCOUNTS)</span></p></div>
<div id="a0000003399" class="solution">Solution for Problem 31:</div>
<span><a name="a0000003400"></a>
<p> Since the church rings its bells every 15 minutes and its bells ring at noon, the church bells ring every multiple of 15 minutes after noon. Similarly, the school bells ring every multiple of 20 minutes after noon and the day care center bells ring every multiple of 25 minutes after noon. So, the next time all three bells ring at the same time must be a multiple of 15 minutes, a multiple of 20 minutes, and a multiple of 25 minutes after noon. In other words, the next time the bells ring together is at <span></span>
 minutes after noon. Again we turn to prime factorizations to find the least common multiple: </p>
<div id="a0000003402" class="math equation">
<div></div>


</div><a name="a0000003403"></a>
<p> So, <span></span>
. Therefore, the bells next ring together 300 minutes after noon. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 300 minutes is <span></span>
 hours, which means the next time the bells ring together is 5 p.m. </p></span>

<div id="a0000003407" class="solution">Solution for Problem 32:</div>
<span><a name="a0000003408"></a>
<p> The common multiples of 6, 7, and 8 are the multiples of the least common multiple of 6, 7, and 8. So, we find the smallest multiple of <span></span>

<p>A number that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 6 is 1 more than a multiple of 6. Similarly, our desired number is 1 more than a multiple of 7, and 1 more than a multiple of 8.

<p>A number that leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 6 is 1 less than a multiple of 6. Similarly, our desired number is 1 less than a multiple of 7, and 1 less than a multiple of 8. So, our desired number is 1 less than a common multiple of 6, 7, and 8. Since <span></span>
