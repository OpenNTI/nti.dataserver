<p>In this book, you will learn about one particular branch of science, the branch called biology. <em>Biology</em> is the science of life. Do you know what life is? Can you define it? Watch &lt;<a>link text</a>http://vimeo.com/9536502&gt; to begin your journey into the study of life. </p>

<p>Look at the duck decoy in <em>Figure</em> [xlink] below [/xlink] . It looks very similar to a real duck. Of course, real ducks are living things. What about the decoy duck? It looks like a duck, but it is actually made of wood. The decoy duck doesn&amp;#8217;t have all the characteristics of a living thing. What characteristics set the real ducks apart from the decoy duck? What are the characteristics of living things? </p><a name="a0000000173"></a>
<p>[,fontfamily=default] </p><a name="a0000000174"></a>
<p>This duck decoy looks like it&amp;#8217;s alive. It even fools real ducks. Why isn&amp;#8217;t it a living thing? </p><a name="a0000000175"></a>
<a name="a0000000176"></a>
<p>To be classified as a living thing, an object must have all six of the following characteristics: </p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li value="1"><a name="a0000000178"></a>
<p>It responds to the environment. </p></li><li value="2"><a name="a0000000179"></a>
<p>It grows and develops. </p></li><li value="3"><a name="a0000000180"></a>
<p>It produces offspring. </p></li><li value="4"><a name="a0000000181"></a>
<p>It maintains homeostasis. </p></li><li value="5"><a name="a0000000182"></a>
<p>It has complex chemistry. </p></li><li value="6"><a name="a0000000183"></a>
<p>It consists of cells. </p></li>

<p>All living things detect changes in their environment and respond to them. What happens if you step on a rock? Nothing; the rock doesn&amp;#8217;t respond because it isn&amp;#8217;t alive. But what if you think you are stepping on a rock and actually step on a turtle shell? The turtle is likely to respond by moving&amp;#8212;it may even snap at you! </p>

<p>All living things grow and develop. For example, a plant seed may look like a lifeless pebble, but under the right conditions it will grow and develop into a plant. Animals also grow and develop. Look at the animals in <em>Figure</em> [xlink] below [/xlink] . How will the tadpoles change as they grow and develop into adult frogs? </p>

<div id="id36066275" class="subsubsection title">Reproduction</div>
<a name="a0000000194"></a>

<p>All living things are capable of reproduction. <em>Reproduction</em> is the process by which living things give rise to offspring. Reproducing may be as simple as a single cell dividing to form two daughter cells. Generally, however, it is much more complicated. Nonetheless, whether a living thing is huge whale or a microscopic bacterium, it is capable of reproduction. A short movie about animal reproduction can be seen at &lt;<a>link text</a>http://videos.howstuffworks.com/hsw/20528-animal-reproduction-two-different-methods-video.htm&gt;. </p>
<div id="id36066302" class="subsubsection title">Keeping Things Constant</div>
<a name="a0000000197"></a>

<p>All living things are able to maintain a more-or-less constant internal environment. They keep things relatively stable on the inside regardless of the conditions around them. The process of maintaining a stable internal environment is called <em>homeostasis</em>. Human beings, for example, maintain a stable internal body temperature. If you go outside when the air temperature is below freezing, your body doesn&amp;#8217;t freeze. Instead, by shivering and other means, it maintains a stable internal temperature. </p>
<div id="id36066322" class="subsubsection title">Complex Chemistry</div>
<a name="a0000000200"></a>

<p>All living things&amp;#8212;even the simplest life forms&amp;#8212;have complex chemistry. Living things consist of large, complex molecules, and they also undergo many complicated chemical changes to stay alive. Complex chemistry is needed to carry out all the functions of life. </p>

<p>All forms of life are built of cells. A <em>cell</em> is the basic unit of the structure and function of living things. Living things may appear very different from one another on the outside, but their cells are very similar. Compare the human cells in <em>Figure</em> [xlink] below [/xlink] and onion cells in <em>Figure</em> [xlink] below [/xlink] . How are they similar? If you click on the animation titled <em>Inside a Cell</em> at the link below, you can look inside a cell and see its internal structures. &lt;<a>link text</a>http://bio-alive.com/animations/cell-biology.htm&gt; </p>

<p>Four unifying principles form the basis of biology. Whether biologists are interested in ancient life, the life of bacteria, or how humans could live on the moon, they base their overall understanding of biology on these four principles: </p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li value="1"><a name="a0000000216"></a>
<p>cell theory </p></li><li value="2"><a name="a0000000217"></a>
<p>gene theory </p></li><li value="3"><a name="a0000000218"></a>
<p>homeostasis </p></li><li value="4"><a name="a0000000219"></a>
<p>evolution </p></li>
</ol><a name="a0000000220"></a>

<div id="id36066481" class="subsubsection title">The Cell Theory</div>
<a name="a0000000221"></a>
<p> <a name="id36066481"></a><a name="a0000000222">text</a>id36066481</p><a name="a0000000223"></a>
<p>According to the <em>cell theory</em>, all living things are made up of cells, and living cells always come from other living cells. In fact, each living thing begins life as a single cell. Some living things, such as bacteria, remain single-celled. Other living things, including plants and animals, grow and develop into many cells. Your own body is made up of an amazing 100 trillion cells! But even you&amp;#8212;like all other living things&amp;#8212;began life as a single cell. </p>
<div id="id36066503" class="subsubsection title">The Gene Theory</div>
<a name="a0000000224"></a>
<p> <a name="id36066503"></a><a name="a0000000225">text</a>id36066503</p><a name="a0000000226"></a>
<p>The <em>gene theory</em> is the idea that the characteristics of living things are controlled by genes, which are passed from parents to their offspring. Genes are located on larger structures, called chromosomes, that are found inside every cell. Chromosomes, in turn, contain large molecules known as DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Molecules of DNA are encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do. To see how this happens, click on the animation titled <em>Journey into DNA</em> at the link below. &lt;<a>link text</a>http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/genome/dna.html&gt; </p>
<div id="id36066529" class="subsubsection title">Homeostasis</div>
<a name="a0000000227"></a>
<p> <a name="id36066529"></a><a name="a0000000228">text</a>id36066529</p><a name="a0000000229"></a>
<p>Homeostasis, or keeping things constant, is not just a characteristic of living things. It also applies to nature as a whole. Consider the concentration of oxygen in Earth&amp;#8217;s atmosphere. Oxygen makes up 21% of the atmosphere, and this concentration is fairly constant. What keeps the concentration of oxygen constant? The answer is living things. Most living things need oxygen to survive, and when they breathe, they remove oxygen from the atmosphere. On the other hand, many living things, including plants, give off oxygen when they make food, and this adds oxygen to the atmosphere. The concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere is maintained mainly by the balance between these two processes. A quick overview of homeostasis can be viewed at &lt;<a>link text</a>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFyt7FJn-UM&gt;. </p>
<div id="id36066547" class="subsubsection title">Evolution</div>
<a name="a0000000230"></a>
<p> <a name="id36066547"></a><a name="a0000000231">text</a>id36066547</p><a name="a0000000232"></a>
<p><em>Evolution</em> is a change in the characteristics of living things over time. Evolution occurs by a process called natural selection. In <em>natural selection</em>, some living things produce more offspring than others, so they pass more genes to the next generation than others do. Over many generations, this can lead to major changes in the characteristics of living things. Evolution explains how living things are changing today and how modern living things have descended from ancient life forms that no longer exist on Earth. As living things evolve, they generally become better suited for their environment. This is because they evolve adaptations. An <em>adaptation</em> is a characteristic that helps a living thing survive and reproduce in a given environment. Look at the mole in <em>Figure</em> [xlink] below [/xlink] . It has tentacles around its nose that it uses to sense things by touch. The mole lives underground in the soil where it is always dark. However, by using its touch organ, it can detect even tiny food items in the soil in total darkness. The touch organ is an adaptation because it helps the mole survive in its dark, underground environment. </p>
<div id="Bio-01-09-Star-nosed-mole" class="figure">
<div class="align-center"><a name="a0000000235">text</a>Bio-01-09-Star-nosed-moleThis mole uses its star-shaped nose organ to sense food by touch in the dark. The mole&amp;#8217;s very large front claws are also an adaptation for its life in the soil. Can you explain why? <img src="resources/book-tx/23dfca092cd5fe373ce0bb013a3e89245a041a99/fd35e23767020999111e1f49239199b4c5eff23e.png" alt="\includegraphics[]{images_001/Bio-01-09-Star_nosed_mole.jpg}" style="width:702.885px; height:355.192px" />

<p>All living things depend on their environment to supply them with what they need, including food, water, and shelter. Their environment consists of physical factors&amp;#8212;such as soil, air, and temperature&amp;#8212;and also of other organisms. An <em>organism</em> is an individual living thing. Many living things interact with other organisms in their environment. In fact, they may need other organisms in order to survive. For example, living things that cannot make their own food must eat other organisms for food. Other interactions between living things include symbiosis and competition. </p>
<div id="id36066661" class="subsubsection title">Symbiosis</div>
<a name="a0000000240"></a>
<p> <a name="id36066661"></a><a name="a0000000241">text</a>id36066661</p><a name="a0000000242"></a>
<p><em>Symbiosis</em> is a close relationship between organisms of different species in which at least one of the organisms benefits. The other organism may also benefit, or it may be unaffected or harmed by the relationship. <em>Figure</em> [xlink] below [/xlink] shows an example of symbiosis. The birds in the picture are able to pick out food from the fur of the deer. The deer won’t eat the birds. In fact, the deer knowingly lets the birds rest on it. What, if anything, do you think the deer gets out of the relationship? </p>
<div id="Bio-01-10-Symbiosis" class="figure">

<p><em>Competition</em> is a relationship between living things that depend on the same resources. The resources may be food, water, or anything else they both need. Competition occurs whenever they both try to get the same resources in the same place and at the same time. The two organisms are likely to come into conflict, and the organism with better adaptations may win out over the other organism. </p>
<div id="id36066738" class="subsubsection title">Levels of Organization</div>

<p>The living world can be organized into different levels. For example, many individual organisms can be organized into the following levels: </p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li><a name="a0000000253"></a>
<p>Cell: basic unit of all living things </p></li><li><a name="a0000000254"></a>
<p><em>Tissue</em>: group of cells of the same kind </p></li><li><a name="a0000000255"></a>
<p><em>Organ</em>: structure composed of one or more types of tissues </p></li><li><a name="a0000000256"></a>
<p><em>Organ system</em>: group of organs that work together to do a certain job </p></li><li><a name="a0000000257"></a>
<p>Organism: individual living thing that may be made up of one or more organ systems </p></li>
</ul><a name="a0000000258"></a>
<p> Examples of these levels of organization are shown in <em>Figure</em> [xlink] below [/xlink] . </p>

The system shown here is the digestive system, which breaks down food to a form that cells can use. One of the organs of the digestive system is the stomach. The stomach, in turn, consists of different types of tissues. Each type of tissue is made up of cells of the same type. <img src="resources/book-tx/7368a3cea74b291f4f324ddcd390ff50d2bf2113/fd35e23767020999111e1f49239199b4c5eff23e.png" alt="\includegraphics[]{images_001/Bio-01-11-Levels-of-organization-from-the-cell-to-organism.png}" style="width:173.654px; height:129.615px" />

<p>Life on Earth is very diverse. The diversity of living things is called <em>biodiversity</em>. A measure of Earth&amp;#8217;s biodiversity is the number of different species of organisms that live on Earth. At least 10 million different species live on Earth today. They are commonly grouped into six different kingdoms. Examples of organisms within each kingdom are shown in <em>Figure</em> [xlink] below [/xlink] . </p>

<p>The diversity of life on Earth today is the result of evolution. Life began on Earth at least 4 billion years ago, and it has been evolving ever since. At first, all living things on Earth were simple, single-celled organisms. Much later, the first multicellular organisms evolved, and after that, Earth&amp;#8217;s biodiversity greatly increased. <em>Figure</em> [xlink] below [/xlink] shows a timeline of the history of life on Earth.

<p>The idea of evolution has been around for centuries. In fact, it goes all the way back to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. However, evolution is most often associated with Charles Darwin. Darwin published a book on evolution in 1869 titled <em>On the Origin of Species</em>. In the book, Darwin stated the theory of evolution by natural selection. He also presented a great deal of evidence that evolution occurs. Despite all the evidence Darwin presented, his theory was not well-received at first. Many people found it hard to accept the idea that humans had evolved from an ape-like ancestor, and they saw evolution as a challenge to their religious beliefs. Look at the cartoon in <em>Figure</em> [xlink] below [/xlink] . Drawn in 1871, it depicts Darwin himself as an ape. The cartoon reflects how many people felt about Darwin and his theory during his own time. Darwin had actually expected this type of reaction to his theory and had waited a long time before publishing his book for this reason. It was only when another scientist, named Alfred Wallace, developed essentially the same theory of evolution that Darwin put his book into print. </p>

<p>Although Darwin presented a great deal of evidence for evolution in his book, he was unable to explain how evolution occurs. That&amp;#8217;s because he knew nothing about genes. As a result, he didn&amp;#8217;t know how characteristics are passed from parents to offspring, let alone how they could change over time. </p>

<p>Since Darwin&amp;#8217;s time, scientists have gathered even more evidence to support the theory of evolution. Some of the evidence comes from fossils, and some comes from studies that show how similar living things are to one another. By the 1930s, scientists had also learned about genes. As a result, they could finally explain how characteristics of organisms could pass from one generation to the next and change over time. </p><a name="a0000000300"></a>
<p>Using modern technology, scientists can now directly compare the genes of living species. The more genes different species share in common, the more closely related the species are presumed to be. Consider humans and chimpanzees. They share about 98% of their genes. This means that they shared a common ancestor in the not-too-distant past. This is just one of many pieces of evidence that show we are part of the evolution of life on Earth. </p>

<p>Today, evolution is still questioned by some people. Often, people who disagree with the theory of evolution do not really understand it. For example, some people think that the theory of evolution explains how life on Earth first began. In fact, the theory explains only how life changed after it first appeared. Some people think the theory of evolution means that humans evolved from modern apes. In fact, humans and modern apes have a common ancestor that lived several million years ago. These and other misconceptions about evolution contribute to the controversy that still surrounds this fundamental principle of biology. </p>
