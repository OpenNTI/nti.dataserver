The lost and bewildered tourist 
The senile old man
A wet and stinky dog
Many cases of infectious disease
Some cookies shaped like stars
A story as old as time
Long and winding road
A cool wet afternoon
He was waiting for the rain to stop.
Watching the pot, he was upset when it didn't boil.
You have been sleeping for a long time.
You might enjoy a massage.
He was eager to eat dinner.
Taking my dog for a walk 
Walking in the rain
Strolling along a beach at sunset
Getting a promotion
Signing autographs
Going for ice cream
Singing for his supper
Getting a sore back
Pulling an all-nighter
Sailing into the sunset
